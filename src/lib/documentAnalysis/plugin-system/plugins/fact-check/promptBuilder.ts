Analyze the following text chunk and extract all factual claims. Focus on:
- Specific statistics or data points (e.g., "GDP was $21T in 2023")
- Historical facts (e.g., "The Berlin Wall fell in 1989")  
- Scientific claims (e.g., "Water boils at 100Â°C at sea level")
- Claims about current events or recent developments
- Statements about organizations, people, or places
- Any claim presented as objective fact

Do NOT extract:
- Opinions or subjective statements
- Predictions about the future
- Hypothetical scenarios
- General statements without specific details

Context around the chunk:
${expandedContext}

Text chunk to analyze:
${chunk.text}

Extract all factual claims, categorizing them by topic, importance to the overall argument, and specificity (how verifiable they are).`;

For each claim below:
1. Assess whether it is factually accurate based on your knowledge
2. Provide a clear explanation of your verification
3. Indicate your confidence level (high/medium/low)

Important guidelines:
- Only mark as "verified: true" if you are confident the claim is accurate
- If you're unsure or the claim is partially true, mark as "verified: false" and explain
- Consider the specific details - dates, numbers, names must be exactly correct
- If a claim is too vague to verify, mark as false with low confidence

Claims to verify:
${claimsText}

Provide thorough explanations that would help readers understand the verification.`;
