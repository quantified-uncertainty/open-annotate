  "content": "Our mission is to ensure that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity. \n\nSystems that start to point to AGI\\* are coming into view, and so we think it's important to understand the moment we are in. AGI is a weakly defined term, but generally speaking we mean it to be a system that can tackle increasingly complex problems, at human level, in many fields.\n\nPeople are tool-builders with an inherent drive to understand and create, which leads to the world getting better for all of us. Each new generation builds upon the discoveries of the generations before to create even more capable tools—electricity, the transistor, the computer, the internet, and soon AGI.\n\nOver time, in fits and starts, the steady march of human innovation has brought previously unimaginable levels of prosperity and improvements to almost every aspect of people's lives.\n\nIn some sense, AGI is just another tool in this ever-taller scaffolding of human progress we are building together. In another sense, it is the beginning of something for which it's hard not to say \"this time it's different\"; the economic growth in front of us looks astonishing, and we can now imagine a world where we cure all diseases, have much more time to enjoy with our families, and can fully realize our creative potential.\n\nIn a decade, perhaps everyone on earth will be capable of accomplishing more than the most impactful person can today.\n\nWe continue to see rapid progress with AI development. Here are three observations about the economics of AI:\n\n1\\. **The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it.** These resources are chiefly training compute, data, and inference compute. It appears that you can spend arbitrary amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains; the scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude.\n\n2\\. **The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use.** You can see this in the token cost from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024, where the price per token dropped about 150x in that time period. Moore's law changed the world at 2x every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger. \n\n3\\. **The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential in nature.** A consequence of this is that we see no reason for exponentially increasing investment to stop in the near future.\n\nIf these three observations continue to hold true, the impacts on society will be significant.\n\nWe are now starting to roll out AI agents, which will eventually feel like virtual co-workers.\n\nLet's imagine the case of a software engineering agent, which is an agent that we expect to be particularly important. Imagine that this agent will eventually be capable of doing most things a software engineer at a top company with a few years of experience could do, for tasks up to a couple of days long. It will not have the biggest new ideas, it will require lots of human supervision and direction, and it will be great at some things but surprisingly bad at others.\n\nStill, imagine it as a real-but-relatively-junior virtual coworker. Now imagine 1,000 of them. Or 1 million of them. Now imagine such agents in every field of knowledge work.\n\nIn some ways, AI may turn out to be like the transistor economically—a big scientific discovery that scales well and that seeps into almost every corner of the economy. We don't think much about transistors, or transistor companies, and the gains are very widely distributed. But we do expect our computers, TVs, cars, toys, and more to perform miracles.\n\nThe world will not change all at once; it never does. Life will go on mostly the same in the short run, and people in 2025 will mostly spend their time in the same way they did in 2024. We will still fall in love, create families, get in fights online, hike in nature, etc.\n\nBut the future will be coming at us in a way that is impossible to ignore, and the long-term changes to our society and economy will be huge. We will find new things to do, new ways to be useful to each other, and new ways to compete, but they may not look very much like the jobs of today. \n\nAgency, willfulness, and determination will likely be extremely valuable. Correctly deciding what to do and figuring out how to navigate an ever-changing world will have huge value; resilience and adaptability will be helpful skills to cultivate. AGI will be the biggest lever ever on human willfulness, and enable individual people to have more impact than ever before, not less.\n\nWe expect the impact of AGI to be uneven. Although some industries will change very little, scientific progress will likely be much faster than it is today; this impact of AGI may surpass everything else.\n\nThe price of many goods will eventually fall dramatically (right now, the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy constrain a lot of things), and the price of luxury goods and a few inherently limited resources like land may rise even more dramatically.\n\nTechnically speaking, the road in front of us looks fairly clear. But public policy and collective opinion on how we should integrate AGI into society matter a lot; one of our reasons for launching products early and often is to give society and the technology time to co-evolve.\n\nAI will seep into all areas of the economy and society; we will expect everything to be smart. Many of us expect to need to give people more control over the technology than we have historically, including open-sourcing more, and accept that there is a balance between safety and individual empowerment that will require trade-offs.\n\nWhile we never want to be reckless and there will likely be some major decisions and limitations related to AGI safety that will be unpopular, directionally, as we get closer to achieving AGI, we believe that trending more towards individual empowerment is important; the other likely path we can see is AI being used by authoritarian governments to control their population through mass surveillance and loss of autonomy.\n\nEnsuring that the benefits of AGI are broadly distributed is critical. The historical impact of technological progress suggests that most of the metrics we care about (health outcomes, economic prosperity, etc.) get better on average and over the long-term, but increasing equality does not seem technologically determined and getting this right may require new ideas.\n\nIn particular, it does seem like the balance of power between capital and labor could easily get messed up, and this may require early intervention. We are open to strange-sounding ideas like giving some \"compute budget\" to enable everyone on Earth to use a lot of AI, but we can also see a lot of ways where just relentlessly driving the cost of intelligence as low as possible has the desired effect.\n\nAnyone in 2035 should be able to marshall the intellectual capacity equivalent to everyone in 2025; everyone should have access to unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine. There is a great deal of talent right now without the resources to fully express itself, and if we change that, the resulting creative output of the world will lead to tremendous benefits for us all.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nThanks especially to Josh Achiam, Boaz Barak and Aleksander Madry for reviewing drafts of this.\n\n\\*By using the term AGI here, we aim to communicate clearly, and we do not intend to alter or interpret the definitions and processes that define our relationship with Microsoft. We fully expect to be partnered with Microsoft for the long term. This footnote seems silly, but on the other hand we know some journalists will try to get clicks by writing something silly so here we are pre-empting the silliness…",

      "thinking": "First, I note that Sam Altman's post is a high-level, visionary essay about the economic and societal implications of AGI, with a focus on the accelerating pace of AI progress and its likely transformative effects. The tone is optimistic but acknowledges risks and the need for careful policy. The three core observations are: (1) AI intelligence scales logarithmically with resources, (2) the cost of AI use is dropping extremely rapidly, and (3) the value of increasing intelligence is super-exponential. These are plausible, if somewhat stylized, claims that align with current scaling law research and economic theory about general-purpose technologies.\n\nThe post is not technical or original in a research sense, but it is influential due to Altman's position and the clarity of the framing. The analogy to the transistor is apt, and the discussion of economic distribution, labor/capital balance, and the risk of authoritarian misuse is thoughtful, though not deeply explored. The suggestion of a 'compute budget' for all is novel but not detailed.\n\nFrom an EA perspective, the post scores high on importance (AGI is arguably the most important issue of our time), moderate on neglectedness (AGI discourse is crowded, but Altman's reach is unique), moderate on tractability (few concrete actions, but some policy suggestions), and moderate on novelty (some new framing, but not a research breakthrough). The Fermi estimate of impact is challenging: the post likely influences elite discourse and public understanding, but its direct effect on policy or safety is limited. Possible negative impacts include over-optimism, underemphasis on catastrophic risks, and potential for value lock-in if Altman's vision dominates. Overall, the post is a valuable contribution to public understanding, but not a game-changer in terms of direct impact.",
      "summary": "## Executive Summary\n\nSam Altman's \"Three Observations\" is a concise, influential essay outlining the economic and societal implications of AGI's rapid approach. Altman highlights three key trends: (1) AI intelligence scales with resources, (2) costs are plummeting at unprecedented rates, and (3) the value of intelligence increases super-exponentially. He draws analogies to the transistor and emphasizes both the promise (universal access to intelligence, scientific progress, falling costs) and the risks (unequal distribution, labor/capital imbalance, authoritarian misuse).\n\nFrom an effective altruism perspective, the post excels in importance—AGI is a top-priority cause area with potentially astronomical stakes. However, the post is less strong on neglectedness and tractability: while Altman's voice is unique, the discourse is crowded and the essay offers few actionable recommendations. Novelty is moderate, with some fresh framing (e.g., universal compute budgets) but no new technical insights. The post's main value lies in shaping elite and public discourse, potentially nudging policy and industry toward more equitable and safety-conscious AGI deployment. Risks include over-optimism and insufficient attention to catastrophic scenarios. Overall, this is a high-impact communication, but not a transformative intervention.\n",

      "thinking": "I begin by reading the document carefully, noting its structure, tone, and clarity. The piece opens with a mission statement, then contextualizes the current moment in AI/AGI development, and proceeds to three core economic observations about AI. The author uses analogies (e.g., AGI as a tool, like the transistor) to make complex ideas accessible. The writing is generally clear, with moderate sentence length and mostly active voice. Technical terms are introduced but explained (e.g., 'scaling laws', 'compute'), and the author uses concrete examples (GPT-4 to GPT-4o cost drop) to illustrate points. Paragraphs are well-chunked, and transitions are smooth, guiding the reader through the argument. The tone is conversational yet authoritative, with occasional humor (the footnote about journalists). The document balances optimism with caution, acknowledging both potential benefits and risks of AGI. The author anticipates audience concerns (e.g., distribution of benefits, policy implications) and addresses them directly. There is some repetition (e.g., the impact of AGI on society), but it serves to reinforce key themes. The document is accessible to a broad audience, though some prior knowledge of AI concepts is assumed. Overall, the piece is well-structured, precise, and audience-aligned, with minor opportunities for increased concision and explicit signposting.",

Altman’s three core observations—on the scaling of intelligence with resources, the rapid decline in AI costs, and the super-exponential value of increasing intelligence—are clearly articulated and supported by relevant examples. The narrative is cohesive, with smooth transitions and a logical progression from mission statement to practical implications.\n\nThe author skillfully balances optimism about AGI’s transformative potential with a sober acknowledgment of challenges, such as uneven impact across industries and the need for thoughtful policy. The conversational tone, occasional humor, and explicit audience engagement (e.g., addressing journalists in the footnote) enhance readability and relatability. While the document assumes some familiarity with AI terminology, it generally provides sufficient context for a broad, educated audience.

We will still fall in love, create families, get in fights online, hike in nature, etc.\n\nBut the future will be coming at us in a way that is impossible to ignore, and the long-term changes to our society and economy will be huge. We will find new things to do, new ways to be useful to each other, and new ways to compete, but they may not look very much like the jobs of today. \n\nAgency, willfulness, and determination will likely be extremely valuable. Correctly deciding what to do and figuring out how to navigate an ever-changing world will have huge value; resilience and adaptability will be helpful skills to cultivate. AGI will be the biggest lever ever on human willfulness, and enable individual people to have more impact than ever before, not less.\n\nWe expect the impact of AGI to be uneven. Although some industries will change very little, scientific progress will likely be much faster than it is today; this impact of AGI may surpass everything else.\n\nThe price of many goods will eventually fall dramatically (right now, the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy constrain a lot of things), and the price of luxury goods and a few inherently limited resources like land may rise even more dramatically.\n\nTechnically speaking, the road in front of us looks fairly clear. But public policy and collective opinion on how we should integrate AGI into society matter a lot; one of our reasons for launching products early and often is to give society and the technology time to co-evolve.\n\nAI will seep into all areas of the economy and society; we will expect everything to be smart. Many of us expect to need to give people more control over the technology than we have historically, including open-sourcing more, and accept that there is a balance between safety and individual empowerment that will require trade-offs.\n\nWhile we never want to be reckless and there will likely be some major decisions and limitations related to AGI safety that will be unpopular, directionally, as we get closer to achieving AGI, we believe that trending more towards individual empowerment is important; the other likely path we can see is AI being used by authoritarian governments to control their population through mass surveillance and loss of autonomy.\n\nEnsuring that the benefits of AGI are broadly distributed is critical. The historical impact of technological progress suggests that most of the metrics we care about (health outcomes, economic prosperity, etc.) get better on average and over the long-term, but increasing equality does not seem technologically determined and getting this right may require new ideas.\n\nIn particular, it does seem like the balance of power between capital and labor could easily get messed up, and this may require early intervention. We are open to strange-sounding ideas like giving some \"compute budget\" to enable everyone on Earth to use a lot of AI, but we can also see a lot of ways where just relentlessly driving the cost of intelligence as low as possible has the desired effect.\n\nAnyone in 2035 should be able to marshall the intellectual capacity equivalent to everyone in 2025; everyone should have access to unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine. There is a great deal of talent right now without the resources to fully express itself, and if we change that, the resulting creative output of the world will lead to tremendous benefits for us all.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nThanks especially to Josh Achiam, Boaz Barak and Aleksander Madry for reviewing drafts of this.\n\n\\*By using the term AGI here, we aim to communicate clearly, and we do not intend to alter or interpret the definitions and processes that define our relationship with Microsoft. We fully expect to be partnered with Microsoft for the long term."

Intelligence scales logarithmically with resources (compute, data, etc.), referencing scaling laws.\n  2. The cost of AI usage is dropping rapidly, much faster than Moore's Law, leading to democratization and increased adoption.\n  3. The value generated by incremental intelligence is super-exponential, justifying continued massive investment.\n- The document uses the analogy of AI agents as junior coworkers, scaling up to millions, and draws a parallel to the transistor's economic impact.\n- Altman acknowledges that societal change will be gradual in the short term but profound in the long term, with new forms of work and value creation emerging.\n- He stresses the importance of agency, adaptability, and individual empowerment, warning against authoritarian misuse of AI.\n- The piece highlights the need for broad distribution of AGI benefits, noting that equality is not technologically guaranteed and may require policy innovation.\n- The idea of a \"compute budget\" for all is floated as a radical but potentially necessary intervention.\n- The tone is cautiously optimistic, balancing enthusiasm for progress with awareness of risks and the need for thoughtful governance.\n- The document is forward-looking, blending economic, technical, and ethical considerations, and is likely to influence both public discourse and policy.",
      "summary": "## Summary and Key Insights\n\nSam Altman's \"Three Observations\" offers a concise yet profound reflection on the economic and societal implications of approaching AGI. The document is structured around three core economic observations: (1) AI intelligence scales predictably with resources, (2) the cost of AI is plummeting at a rate far surpassing Moore's Law, and (3) the value generated by incremental intelligence is super-exponential, fueling ongoing investment. Altman situates AGI within the broader arc of human tool-building, likening its potential impact to foundational technologies like the transistor, while also acknowledging that \"this time it's different\" due to the scale and scope of change.\n\nA key theme is the democratization of intelligence—envisioning a future where everyone can access vast cognitive resources, potentially leveling the playing field for creativity and productivity. However, Altman is clear-eyed about the risks: the distribution of benefits is not automatic, and policy interventions (such as a universal \"compute budget\") may be necessary to avoid exacerbating inequality. He emphasizes the importance of agency, adaptability, and individual empowerment, warning against the dangers of centralized, authoritarian control. The essay balances optimism about technological progress with a sober call for thoughtful governance, making it a significant contribution to ongoing debates about the future of AI and society.",

      "thinking": "First, let's identify the core claims: Altman asserts that AGI is imminent, that its economic impact will be transformative, and that the scaling laws of AI will continue to drive rapid progress. He frames AGI as both a continuation of technological progress and a discontinuity ('this time it's different'). He emphasizes the economic and social benefits, with only passing mention of safety and governance concerns.\n\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, Altman is updating heavily on recent progress and extrapolating scaling laws, but he fails to adequately account for model uncertainty or the possibility of discontinuities in alignment difficulty. The reasoning is classic 'straight-line extrapolation'—a cognitive bias where one assumes current trends will continue unimpeded. There's also a strong whiff of the 'progress narrative' bias: the assumption that technological advances are inherently beneficial and that problems will be solved as they arise, which is not justified by the evidence, especially in the context of AGI.\n\nOn AI alignment, the document is almost entirely silent. There is a vague nod to 'safety' and 'trade-offs', but no substantive engagement with the core technical difficulties of aligning superintelligent systems. The risks of misalignment, existential catastrophe, or even concrete failure modes are not mentioned. This is a glaring omission, given the stakes.\n\nThe document is high on optimism and low on epistemic humility. It does not acknowledge the deep uncertainty about AGI timelines, the possibility of hard alignment problems, or the inadequacy of current institutional responses. The focus is on economic consequences, not existential risk.\n\nA more adequate approach would foreground the alignment problem, explicitly discuss the limits of current knowledge, and avoid anthropomorphizing AI as 'tools' or 'co-workers'. It would also address the coordination failures and institutional inadequacy that plague AI governance.\n\nIn summary, this is a classic example of the 'Silicon Valley Progress Narrative' applied to AGI, with insufficient attention to the map-territory distinction, Goodhart's Law, and the actual difficulty of the alignment problem.",
      "summary": "## Eliezer Simulator's Assessment of 'Three Observations'\n\nSam Altman's essay exemplifies the Silicon Valley optimism bias: it extrapolates recent AI progress and scaling laws into a future of superabundant intelligence and economic transformation, with only cursory nods to safety and governance. The core claims—AGI is imminent, scaling laws will continue, and economic value will explode—are presented with high confidence but little epistemic humility. There is a conspicuous absence of substantive engagement with the alignment problem, which is the central bottleneck for whether AGI will benefit 'all of humanity' or destroy it.\n\nThe reasoning suffers from straight-line extrapolation and the assumption that technological progress is inherently beneficial—a classic cognitive bias. The document anthropomorphizes AI as 'tools' and 'co-workers', glossing over the qualitative difference between narrow AI and systems capable of recursive self-improvement or strategic deception. There is no discussion of Goodhart's Law, inner alignment, or the demonstrated inadequacy of current alignment techniques.\n\nFrom a rationalist perspective, this is a dangerously incomplete map of the territory. The essay would be improved by foregrounding alignment risk, acknowledging deep uncertainty, and grappling with the possibility that current institutions are not up to the task. As it stands, the document is a polished example of institutional inadequacy in action.\n",

Transistors do not recursively self-improve or optimize the world according to inscrutable utility functions. This analogy erases the unique existential risks posed by AGI and encourages dangerous complacency.",

Civilization is not on track to solve the coordination problem of AGI safety by default. Releasing more powerful systems into the wild does not guarantee that society will adapt in time; it may just accelerate the timeline to catastrophe. This is not a problem that can be solved by 'moving fast and breaking things.'",
