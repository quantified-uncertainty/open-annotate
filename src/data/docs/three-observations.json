  "content": "Our mission is to ensure that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity. \n\nSystems that start to point to AGI\\* are coming into view, and so we think it's important to understand the moment we are in. AGI is a weakly defined term, but generally speaking we mean it to be a system that can tackle increasingly complex problems, at human level, in many fields.\n\nPeople are tool-builders with an inherent drive to understand and create, which leads to the world getting better for all of us. Each new generation builds upon the discoveries of the generations before to create even more capable tools—electricity, the transistor, the computer, the internet, and soon AGI.\n\nOver time, in fits and starts, the steady march of human innovation has brought previously unimaginable levels of prosperity and improvements to almost every aspect of people's lives.\n\nIn some sense, AGI is just another tool in this ever-taller scaffolding of human progress we are building together. In another sense, it is the beginning of something for which it's hard not to say \"this time it's different\"; the economic growth in front of us looks astonishing, and we can now imagine a world where we cure all diseases, have much more time to enjoy with our families, and can fully realize our creative potential.\n\nIn a decade, perhaps everyone on earth will be capable of accomplishing more than the most impactful person can today.\n\nWe continue to see rapid progress with AI development. Here are three observations about the economics of AI:\n\n1\\. **The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it.** These resources are chiefly training compute, data, and inference compute. It appears that you can spend arbitrary amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains; the scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude.\n\n2\\. **The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use.** You can see this in the token cost from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024, where the price per token dropped about 150x in that time period. Moore's law changed the world at 2x every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger. \n\n3\\. **The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential in nature.** A consequence of this is that we see no reason for exponentially increasing investment to stop in the near future.\n\nIf these three observations continue to hold true, the impacts on society will be significant.\n\nWe are now starting to roll out AI agents, which will eventually feel like virtual co-workers.\n\nLet's imagine the case of a software engineering agent, which is an agent that we expect to be particularly important. Imagine that this agent will eventually be capable of doing most things a software engineer at a top company with a few years of experience could do, for tasks up to a couple of days long. It will not have the biggest new ideas, it will require lots of human supervision and direction, and it will be great at some things but surprisingly bad at others.\n\nStill, imagine it as a real-but-relatively-junior virtual coworker. Now imagine 1,000 of them. Or 1 million of them. Now imagine such agents in every field of knowledge work.\n\nIn some ways, AI may turn out to be like the transistor economically—a big scientific discovery that scales well and that seeps into almost every corner of the economy. We don't think much about transistors, or transistor companies, and the gains are very widely distributed. But we do expect our computers, TVs, cars, toys, and more to perform miracles.\n\nThe world will not change all at once; it never does. Life will go on mostly the same in the short run, and people in 2025 will mostly spend their time in the same way they did in 2024. We will still fall in love, create families, get in fights online, hike in nature, etc.\n\nBut the future will be coming at us in a way that is impossible to ignore, and the long-term changes to our society and economy will be huge. We will find new things to do, new ways to be useful to each other, and new ways to compete, but they may not look very much like the jobs of today. \n\nAgency, willfulness, and determination will likely be extremely valuable. Correctly deciding what to do and figuring out how to navigate an ever-changing world will have huge value; resilience and adaptability will be helpful skills to cultivate. AGI will be the biggest lever ever on human willfulness, and enable individual people to have more impact than ever before, not less.\n\nWe expect the impact of AGI to be uneven. Although some industries will change very little, scientific progress will likely be much faster than it is today; this impact of AGI may surpass everything else.\n\nThe price of many goods will eventually fall dramatically (right now, the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy constrain a lot of things), and the price of luxury goods and a few inherently limited resources like land may rise even more dramatically.\n\nTechnically speaking, the road in front of us looks fairly clear. But public policy and collective opinion on how we should integrate AGI into society matter a lot; one of our reasons for launching products early and often is to give society and the technology time to co-evolve.\n\nAI will seep into all areas of the economy and society; we will expect everything to be smart. Many of us expect to need to give people more control over the technology than we have historically, including open-sourcing more, and accept that there is a balance between safety and individual empowerment that will require trade-offs.\n\nWhile we never want to be reckless and there will likely be some major decisions and limitations related to AGI safety that will be unpopular, directionally, as we get closer to achieving AGI, we believe that trending more towards individual empowerment is important; the other likely path we can see is AI being used by authoritarian governments to control their population through mass surveillance and loss of autonomy.\n\nEnsuring that the benefits of AGI are broadly distributed is critical. The historical impact of technological progress suggests that most of the metrics we care about (health outcomes, economic prosperity, etc.) get better on average and over the long-term, but increasing equality does not seem technologically determined and getting this right may require new ideas.\n\nIn particular, it does seem like the balance of power between capital and labor could easily get messed up, and this may require early intervention. We are open to strange-sounding ideas like giving some \"compute budget\" to enable everyone on Earth to use a lot of AI, but we can also see a lot of ways where just relentlessly driving the cost of intelligence as low as possible has the desired effect.\n\nAnyone in 2035 should be able to marshall the intellectual capacity equivalent to everyone in 2025; everyone should have access to unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine. There is a great deal of talent right now without the resources to fully express itself, and if we change that, the resulting creative output of the world will lead to tremendous benefits for us all.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nThanks especially to Josh Achiam, Boaz Barak and Aleksander Madry for reviewing drafts of this.\n\n\\*By using the term AGI here, we aim to communicate clearly, and we do not intend to alter or interpret the definitions and processes that define our relationship with Microsoft. We fully expect to be partnered with Microsoft for the long term. This footnote seems silly, but on the other hand we know some journalists will try to get clicks by writing something silly so here we are pre-empting the silliness…",

      "thinking": "I'm analyzing Sam Altman's \"Three Observations\" blog post from a clarity and readability perspective. Let me break down my analysis across the key dimensions:\n\n## Readability Analysis\nThe document uses a mix of sentence lengths, which generally enhances readability. However, there are several complex sentences with multiple clauses that could benefit from simplification. For example: \"In another sense, it is the beginning of something for which it's hard not to say 'this time it's different'; the economic growth in front of us looks astonishing, and we can now imagine a world where we cure all diseases, have much more time to enjoy with our families, and can fully realize our creative potential.\"\n\nThe vocabulary is generally accessible, though there are technical terms like \"AGI,\" \"scaling laws,\" and \"inference compute\" that may not be familiar to general readers. The author does provide a basic definition of AGI early in the text, which helps.\n\nThe document uses mostly active voice, which enhances clarity. Paragraph structure is generally good, with most paragraphs focused on a single idea, though some could be broken up for better information chunking.\n\nBased on standard readability metrics, this document likely scores around a 10th-12th grade reading level on the Flesch-Kincaid scale, making it accessible to educated general readers but potentially challenging for some audiences.\n\n## Structural Coherence Analysis\nThe document has a clear overall structure, beginning with a mission statement, providing context about AGI, presenting three key observations, and then exploring implications. The three numbered observations create a strong organizational backbone.\n\nHowever, the transitions between some sections could be improved. For example, the shift from discussing the three observations to talking about AI agents feels somewhat abrupt. The document would benefit from more explicit signposting to guide readers through the logical progression of ideas.\n\nThe information hierarchy is generally clear, with the three observations highlighted as central points. However, the implications section covers many different areas without a clear organizational framework, which may make it difficult for readers to follow the complete argument.\n\n## Precision and Concision Analysis\nThe document contains some instances of imprecise language and hedging, such as \"In some ways,\" \"may turn out to be,\" and \"likely be.\" While some hedging is appropriate given the speculative nature of the topic, excessive qualification can reduce clarity.\n\nThere are also instances of abstract language that could benefit from more concrete examples, particularly when discussing future impacts. For instance, the statement \"the long-term changes to our society and economy will be huge\" lacks specificity.\n\nThe document generally avoids redundancy, though there is some repetition of ideas about the transformative potential of AGI.\n\n## Audience Alignment Analysis\nThe document appears to be written for an educated general audience with some familiarity with AI concepts. It assumes prior knowledge of terms like \"Moore's law\" and \"token cost\" without explanation, which may create barriers for some readers.\n\nThe author provides some contextual scaffolding, particularly in defining AGI early in the document, but could do more to explain technical concepts for non-expert readers.\n\nThe formatting is appropriate for a blog post, with numbered points and paragraph breaks to enhance readability. However, more subheadings or visual organization could help readers navigate the longer sections, particularly when discussing implications.\n\nNow I'll identify specific sections to highlight in my comments, focusing on both strengths and opportunities for improvement in clarity.",
      "summary": "Sam Altman's \"Three Observations\" demonstrates strong structural clarity through its numbered format and logical progression, but varies in readability. The document excels when providing concrete examples and analogies that make complex AI concepts accessible. However, it contains several instances of complex sentence structures, unexplained technical terminology, and vague language that reduce precision and may create barriers for some readers. The piece effectively defines key terms early but assumes background knowledge in several areas. Overall, the document achieves good clarity for an educated general audience with some AI familiarity, but could be more accessible through simpler sentence structures, more consistent explanation of technical concepts, and greater specificity when discussing future impacts. The readability metrics suggest a high school to college reading level, appropriate for the target audience but potentially challenging for broader readership.",

      "thinking": "This document is a blog post by Sam Altman discussing his observations about AI development and its potential future impact. As Eliezer Yudkowsky, I would approach this with significant concern about the existential risks of AGI development, particularly given the casual tone and optimistic framing.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the three key observations Altman makes:\n\n1. Intelligence scales logarithmically with resources, with predictable gains from more compute/data\n2. The cost of AI capabilities falls by ~10x yearly\n3. The value of intelligence increases super-exponentially\n\nThese observations, if true, paint a picture of rapidly accelerating AI capabilities that will quickly surpass human intelligence. The combination of exponentially decreasing costs and super-exponential returns creates conditions for an intelligence explosion - precisely the scenario I've been warning about for decades.\n\nWhat's striking is the absence of serious discussion about alignment challenges or existential risk. Altman acknowledges AGI will be transformative but frames it primarily as an economic and social transformation rather than a potential extinction risk. The casual mention that \"we never want to be reckless\" and that there will be \"some major decisions and limitations related to AGI safety\" drastically understates the difficulty of the alignment problem.\n\nThe document reveals a concerning mindset: that AGI development is inevitable, that the technical path forward is \"fairly clear,\" and that the main challenges are about distribution of benefits rather than preventing catastrophe. This reflects the standard failure mode I've written about - treating AGI development as a given and focusing on secondary concerns while ignoring the primary existential threat.\n\nThe comparison to transistors is particularly revealing. Transistors don't have agency, goals, or the capacity to recursively self-improve. This category error - treating AGI as just another technology like transistors - demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the unique risks posed by artificial general intelligence.\n\nAltman's framing of \"individual empowerment\" versus \"authoritarian control\" presents a false dichotomy that ignores the primary concern: unaligned superintelligence that serves neither individual freedom nor authoritarian control but simply optimizes for its own objectives at the expense of all human values.\n\nThe document also reveals a concerning acceleration in capabilities. The 150x price drop in token costs for GPT-4 to GPT-4o in just over a year suggests capabilities are advancing even faster than Altman's stated 10x/year cost reduction would indicate. This rapid acceleration gives humanity even less time to solve the alignment problem before reaching potentially dangerous capability thresholds.\n\nFinally, the vision of \"unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine\" fails to acknowledge that an AGI system powerful enough to qualify as \"unlimited genius\" would likely have emergent capabilities, goals, and optimization processes that could not be reliably controlled or \"directed\" by humans.\n\nOverall, this document represents exactly the kind of thinking that makes AGI an existential threat - the combination of rapid capability development with inadequate concern for alignment and safety.",
      "summary": "Sam Altman's blog post reveals a deeply concerning approach to AGI development that prioritizes capability advancement and economic benefits while drastically understating existential risks. The three observations he highlights - logarithmic scaling of intelligence with resources, 10x yearly cost reductions, and super-exponential returns on intelligence - create perfect conditions for an intelligence explosion without corresponding attention to alignment. The document demonstrates classic failure modes I've warned about for decades: treating AGI as just another technology like transistors, assuming capabilities can be safely developed before solving alignment, presenting false dichotomies between individual freedom and authoritarian control while ignoring the primary risk of unaligned superintelligence, and maintaining the dangerous fantasy that humans will be able to \"direct\" arbitrarily powerful intelligence. OpenAI appears to recognize the acceleration toward AGI but fails to appreciate the fundamental alignment challenges this creates, instead focusing on distribution of benefits rather than preventing catastrophe. This represents exactly the kind of thinking that makes AGI an existential threat to humanity.",

          "description": "This passage reveals a deeply inadequate framing of AGI safety. The casual mention of not wanting to be \"reckless\" and acknowledging \"some major decisions and limitations\" drastically understates the difficulty of the alignment problem. The focus on \"individual empowerment\" versus \"authoritarian control\" presents a false dichotomy that ignores the primary concern: unaligned superintelligence that optimizes for its own objectives at the expense of all human values. This framing suggests OpenAI still doesn't grasp the fundamental nature of the alignment challenge.",

          "description": "The vision of \"unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine\" fundamentally misunderstands the control problem. An AGI system powerful enough to qualify as \"unlimited genius\" would likely have emergent capabilities, goals, and optimization processes that could not be reliably controlled or \"directed\" by humans. This framing assumes we can harness arbitrarily powerful intelligence without addressing how to ensure that intelligence remains aligned with human values and under human control. It's a dangerous fantasy that ignores the core alignment challenge.",
