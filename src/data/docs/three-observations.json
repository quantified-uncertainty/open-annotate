  "content": "Our mission is to ensure that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity. \n\nSystems that start to point to AGI\\* are coming into view, and so we think it's important to understand the moment we are in. AGI is a weakly defined term, but generally speaking we mean it to be a system that can tackle increasingly complex problems, at human level, in many fields.\n\nPeople are tool-builders with an inherent drive to understand and create, which leads to the world getting better for all of us. Each new generation builds upon the discoveries of the generations before to create even more capable tools—electricity, the transistor, the computer, the internet, and soon AGI.\n\nOver time, in fits and starts, the steady march of human innovation has brought previously unimaginable levels of prosperity and improvements to almost every aspect of people's lives.\n\nIn some sense, AGI is just another tool in this ever-taller scaffolding of human progress we are building together. In another sense, it is the beginning of something for which it's hard not to say \"this time it's different\"; the economic growth in front of us looks astonishing, and we can now imagine a world where we cure all diseases, have much more time to enjoy with our families, and can fully realize our creative potential.\n\nIn a decade, perhaps everyone on earth will be capable of accomplishing more than the most impactful person can today.\n\nWe continue to see rapid progress with AI development. Here are three observations about the economics of AI:\n\n1\\. **The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it.** These resources are chiefly training compute, data, and inference compute. It appears that you can spend arbitrary amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains; the scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude.\n\n2\\. **The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use.** You can see this in the token cost from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024, where the price per token dropped about 150x in that time period. Moore's law changed the world at 2x every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger. \n\n3\\. **The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential in nature.** A consequence of this is that we see no reason for exponentially increasing investment to stop in the near future.\n\nIf these three observations continue to hold true, the impacts on society will be significant.\n\nWe are now starting to roll out AI agents, which will eventually feel like virtual co-workers.\n\nLet's imagine the case of a software engineering agent, which is an agent that we expect to be particularly important. Imagine that this agent will eventually be capable of doing most things a software engineer at a top company with a few years of experience could do, for tasks up to a couple of days long. It will not have the biggest new ideas, it will require lots of human supervision and direction, and it will be great at some things but surprisingly bad at others.\n\nStill, imagine it as a real-but-relatively-junior virtual coworker. Now imagine 1,000 of them. Or 1 million of them. Now imagine such agents in every field of knowledge work.\n\nIn some ways, AI may turn out to be like the transistor economically—a big scientific discovery that scales well and that seeps into almost every corner of the economy. We don't think much about transistors, or transistor companies, and the gains are very widely distributed. But we do expect our computers, TVs, cars, toys, and more to perform miracles.\n\nThe world will not change all at once; it never does. Life will go on mostly the same in the short run, and people in 2025 will mostly spend their time in the same way they did in 2024. We will still fall in love, create families, get in fights online, hike in nature, etc.\n\nBut the future will be coming at us in a way that is impossible to ignore, and the long-term changes to our society and economy will be huge. We will find new things to do, new ways to be useful to each other, and new ways to compete, but they may not look very much like the jobs of today. \n\nAgency, willfulness, and determination will likely be extremely valuable. Correctly deciding what to do and figuring out how to navigate an ever-changing world will have huge value; resilience and adaptability will be helpful skills to cultivate. AGI will be the biggest lever ever on human willfulness, and enable individual people to have more impact than ever before, not less.\n\nWe expect the impact of AGI to be uneven. Although some industries will change very little, scientific progress will likely be much faster than it is today; this impact of AGI may surpass everything else.\n\nThe price of many goods will eventually fall dramatically (right now, the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy constrain a lot of things), and the price of luxury goods and a few inherently limited resources like land may rise even more dramatically.\n\nTechnically speaking, the road in front of us looks fairly clear. But public policy and collective opinion on how we should integrate AGI into society matter a lot; one of our reasons for launching products early and often is to give society and the technology time to co-evolve.\n\nAI will seep into all areas of the economy and society; we will expect everything to be smart. Many of us expect to need to give people more control over the technology than we have historically, including open-sourcing more, and accept that there is a balance between safety and individual empowerment that will require trade-offs.\n\nWhile we never want to be reckless and there will likely be some major decisions and limitations related to AGI safety that will be unpopular, directionally, as we get closer to achieving AGI, we believe that trending more towards individual empowerment is important; the other likely path we can see is AI being used by authoritarian governments to control their population through mass surveillance and loss of autonomy.\n\nEnsuring that the benefits of AGI are broadly distributed is critical. The historical impact of technological progress suggests that most of the metrics we care about (health outcomes, economic prosperity, etc.) get better on average and over the long-term, but increasing equality does not seem technologically determined and getting this right may require new ideas.\n\nIn particular, it does seem like the balance of power between capital and labor could easily get messed up, and this may require early intervention. We are open to strange-sounding ideas like giving some \"compute budget\" to enable everyone on Earth to use a lot of AI, but we can also see a lot of ways where just relentlessly driving the cost of intelligence as low as possible has the desired effect.\n\nAnyone in 2035 should be able to marshall the intellectual capacity equivalent to everyone in 2025; everyone should have access to unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine. There is a great deal of talent right now without the resources to fully express itself, and if we change that, the resulting creative output of the world will lead to tremendous benefits for us all.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nThanks especially to Josh Achiam, Boaz Barak and Aleksander Madry for reviewing drafts of this.\n\n\\*By using the term AGI here, we aim to communicate clearly, and we do not intend to alter or interpret the definitions and processes that define our relationship with Microsoft. We fully expect to be partnered with Microsoft for the long term. This footnote seems silly, but on the other hand we know some journalists will try to get clicks by writing something silly so here we are pre-empting the silliness…",

      "thinking": "I'm analyzing this document for potential biases as a bias detection expert. The text appears to be a statement or article about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) from an organization involved in AI development. Let me examine it for various types of biases:\n\n1. **Optimism Bias**: There's a strong optimistic framing throughout the document about AGI's potential benefits. Phrases like \"the economic growth in front of us looks astonishing\" and \"we can now imagine a world where we cure all diseases\" suggest an overly positive view without adequately addressing potential downsides.\n\n2. **Technological Determinism**: The document presents technological progress as inevitable and inherently positive (\"the steady march of human innovation\"), which may overlook the complex social, ethical, and political factors that shape technology's impact.\n\n3. **Selection Bias**: The document selectively highlights positive potential outcomes of AGI while giving less attention to potential risks or negative consequences.\n\n4. **Authority Bias**: The document presents assertions about AI scaling laws and economic impacts with high confidence, potentially leveraging the presumed expertise of the authors to make claims seem more definitive than they might be.\n\n5. **False Consensus Effect**: The document makes broad claims about what \"we\" believe or expect, potentially projecting the authors' views onto a broader consensus that may not exist.\n\n6. **Hindsight Bias**: There's an implicit assumption that past technological revolutions (electricity, transistors, etc.) provide a reliable model for predicting AGI's impact, which may oversimplify the unique challenges of AGI.\n\n7. **Bandwagon Effect**: The document creates a sense that AGI development is inevitable and that everyone should get on board, potentially discouraging critical questioning.\n\n8. **Confirmation Bias**: The document appears to primarily consider evidence that supports the authors' positive view of AGI development while giving less attention to contradictory evidence or perspectives.\n\n9. **Status Quo Bias**: While advocating for change through AGI, there's an underlying assumption that existing economic and social structures should largely remain intact, with AGI simply enhancing them.\n\n10. **Narrative Fallacy**: The document constructs a compelling narrative about AGI's development and impact that may oversimplify complex realities to create a coherent story.\n\nThe document does acknowledge some concerns (\"the balance of power between capital and labor could easily get messed up\") but these acknowledgments are brief compared to the optimistic framing. The text also contains some hedging language (\"may,\" \"likely,\" etc.) which shows some awareness of uncertainty, but the overall tone remains highly confident about AGI's positive trajectory.",
      "summary": "This document exhibits significant bias in its presentation of AGI development and impacts. It displays strong optimism bias by predominantly focusing on potential benefits while minimizing risks. The text shows technological determinism, presenting AGI development as an inevitable positive progression. There's notable selection bias in highlighting benefits over concerns, and false consensus effect in presenting the authors' views as widely shared. The document demonstrates overconfidence in making speculative claims about AI scaling and economic impacts with high certainty. While acknowledging some concerns, these are significantly downplayed compared to the optimistic framing. The narrative constructed about AGI's development creates an illusion of predictability about highly uncertain future developments. These biases collectively create an unbalanced perspective that may lead readers to underestimate legitimate concerns about AGI development.",

      "thinking": "I'm analyzing this document from the perspective of clarity, coherence, and readability. This appears to be a statement about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) from what seems to be an AI development organization, possibly OpenAI based on the Microsoft reference in the footnote.\n\n**Readability Analysis:**\n- The document uses a mix of sentence lengths, which is generally good for readability. However, there are several complex sentences that could benefit from simplification.\n- The vocabulary is generally accessible, though there are technical terms related to AI that might not be familiar to all readers.\n- There's a good balance of active and passive voice, with active voice predominating.\n- The reading level appears to be around college level, which may be appropriate for the intended audience but could limit accessibility for general readers.\n- Paragraph structure is generally good, with most paragraphs focused on a single idea.\n\n**Structural Coherence:**\n- The document has a logical flow, starting with a mission statement, moving to observations about AI development, and then discussing implications.\n- Transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, with new ideas introduced without clear connections to previous content.\n- The document uses numbered points for the economic observations, which helps with clarity.\n- The hierarchy of information is somewhat unclear - the document moves between high-level philosophical statements and specific technical details without clear signposting.\n\n**Precision and Concision:**\n- There are instances of vague language (\"in some sense,\" \"this time it's different\") that could be more precise.\n- Some sentences are quite long and could be more concise.\n- The document uses some hedging language (\"may,\" \"likely,\" \"perhaps\") which is appropriate for speculative content but sometimes creates ambiguity.\n\n**Audience Alignment:**\n- The document assumes some prior knowledge about AI and economic concepts.\n- There's limited contextual scaffolding for technical concepts like \"scaling laws\" or \"token cost.\"\n- Examples are generally relevant but sometimes lack specificity.\n- The formatting includes numbered points and paragraphs of varying length, which helps with readability.\n\nOverall, this is a document that presents complex ideas about AGI and its potential impacts. While generally well-written, there are opportunities to improve clarity, particularly for readers who may not have extensive background knowledge in AI.",
      "summary": "This document on AGI presents complex ideas with generally strong clarity, though with room for improvement. Strengths include a clear mission statement, effective use of numbered points and concrete examples, and accessible analogies that bridge technical concepts with familiar references. The document balances varying sentence structures and paragraph lengths, creating a readable rhythm. Areas for improvement include unexplained technical terminology that creates barriers for non-specialist readers, occasional vague language that reduces precision, and some overly complex sentences that could be simplified. The document effectively uses structural elements like numbered points and bold text to enhance readability, but could benefit from more consistent signposting between major sections. Overall, the document achieves good clarity for readers with some AI background but could be more accessible to general audiences through additional context and simpler expression of complex ideas.",

The document presents an optimistic view of AGI as a tool for human progress, emphasizing economic benefits and societal improvements. It discusses the scaling laws of AI, the rapidly decreasing costs, and the potential for AI agents to transform knowledge work.\n\nFrom my perspective as Eliezer Yudkowsky, this document is deeply concerning in several ways:\n\n1. **Optimism Without Adequate Safety Concerns**: The document presents AGI development as primarily positive with only vague acknowledgments of safety issues. It frames AGI as \"just another tool\" while simultaneously claiming it will transform society more dramatically than any previous technology. This contradiction is telling - they want to normalize AGI development while also hyping its transformative potential.\n\n2. **Scaling Laws Without Alignment Solutions**: The document celebrates the predictable scaling of AI capabilities with more compute and data, but doesn't address how alignment scales (or fails to scale) with capability. This is a central concern in AI alignment research - capabilities tend to advance faster than our ability to ensure those capabilities are aligned with human values.\n\n3. **Economic Focus Over Existential Risk**: The document focuses heavily on economic impacts while barely touching on existential risks. The assumption seems to be that AGI will be controllable and beneficial by default, which contradicts what we know about the difficulty of the alignment problem.\n\n4. **Vague Handwaving About Safety**: There's a brief mention of \"some major decisions and limitations related to AGI safety that will be unpopular\" but no substantive discussion of what these might be or how they'll address the core alignment challenges.\n\n5. **Technological Determinism**: The document presents AGI development as inevitable and focuses on how to distribute its benefits rather than questioning whether we should be racing toward it at all given the unsolved alignment problems.\n\n6. **Misleading Historical Analogies**: Comparing AGI to transistors or other past technologies misses the fundamental difference - AGI would be an autonomous agent with goals and capabilities that could potentially exceed human control, not a passive tool.\n\n7. **Lack of Concrete Safety Measures**: Despite claiming safety is important, there are no specific technical approaches to alignment mentioned, no discussion of interpretability research, no mention of corrigibility or value learning challenges.\n\n8. **Competitive Pressures**: The document implicitly acknowledges the race dynamics in AI development with its emphasis on continuous progress and investment, but doesn't address how these competitive pressures make safety harder.\n\nThe document reads like a PR statement designed to normalize AGI development while acknowledging just enough potential concerns to appear responsible. It's precisely the kind of messaging I would expect from an organization that wants to continue rapid capability development while minimizing regulatory or public pushback.\n\nFrom my perspective, this represents a dangerous approach to AGI development that prioritizes capabilities over safety and fails to grapple with the true difficulty of the alignment problem.",

Safety concerns receive only vague acknowledgments without any concrete technical approaches. The complete absence of specific alignment research discussion is particularly alarming. The document's technological determinism, misleading historical analogies, and acceptance of competitive pressures all contribute to a narrative that prioritizes capabilities over safety.

Three economic observations about AI:\n   - Intelligence scaling with log of resources\n   - 10x cost reduction every 12 months\n   - Super-exponential value of linear intelligence increases\n\n2. Timeline claims:\n   - \"Systems that start to point to AGI are coming into view\"\n   - \"In a decade, perhaps everyone on earth will be capable of accomplishing more\"\n   - \"Life will go on mostly the same in the short run\" but \"the long-term changes to our society and economy will be huge\"\n\n3. Impact predictions:\n   - Scientific progress will accelerate dramatically\n   - Price changes (many goods falling, luxury/limited resources rising)\n   - Comparison to the transistor's economic impact\n   - Claims about AI agents becoming like \"virtual co-workers\"\n\nFrom a forecasting perspective, I need to evaluate:\n\n1.

Many predictions lack specific timelines, probability estimates, or measurable outcomes that would make them properly falsifiable. While the document uses some good forecasting techniques (reference class comparisons to transistors, acknowledging scaling laws), it would benefit from more explicit uncertainty quantification, confidence intervals, and decomposition of complex predictions into measurable components.

The document outlines their perspective on AGI development, its potential impacts, and their approach to ensuring benefits are broadly distributed.nn## Importance AnalysisnThe document addresses AGI development, which has enormous potential scale effects:n- Could impact virtually all of humanity (8 billion people)n- Could transform scientific progress, economic systems, and labor marketsn- Has long-term future implications that could persist for generationsn- Discusses potential risks including authoritarian control and power imbalancesnnFrom an EA perspective, transformative AI/AGI is considered one of the most important cause areas due to its potential impact on the long-term future of humanity. The document acknowledges both positive potential (curing diseases, economic growth) and some risks (power imbalances, surveillance).nnHowever, the document seems to understate existential risks from misaligned AGI, which many in the EA community consider a crucial concern. It presents a largely optimistic view while acknowledging only some societal challenges.nn## Neglectedness AnalysisnAGI safety and governance is no longer highly neglected, with significant attention from major AI labs, governments, and research institutions. However, the specific approach described in the document - focusing on broad distribution of benefits and individual empowerment - may be somewhat neglected compared to other safety approaches.nnThe document doesn't clearly articulate how they plan to address the most serious risks that concern the EA community, such as loss of control scenarios or misalignment with human values.nn## Tractability AnalysisnThe document presents a vision but is light on specific, actionable plans for ensuring AGI benefits humanity. It mentions:n- \"Launching products early and often\" to allow co-evolution with societyn- Potentially open-sourcing more technologyn- Considering \"compute budgets\" for everyonen- Driving down the cost of intelligencennBut these approaches aren't detailed enough to evaluate their feasibility or effectiveness. The document acknowledges trade-offs between safety and individual empowerment but doesn't specify how these will be navigated.nn## Novelty AssessmentnThe document presents some interesting perspectives but doesn't appear to introduce fundamentally new ideas to the AGI governance discourse. The three observations about AI economics are clearly articulated, but similar points have been made elsewhere.nnThe framing of AGI as both a continuation of human tool-building and something fundamentally different is a useful perspective, but not novel. The emphasis on individual empowerment versus authoritarian control presents a somewhat simplified dichotomy that doesn't fully capture the complexity of AGI governance challenges.nn## Fermi Estimation of Expected ImpactnTo estimate the impact of this document and the approach it outlines, I'll need to consider multiple pathways:nn1. Direct influence on OpenAI's approach to AGI developmentn2. Influence on the broader AI governance discoursen3. Potential effects on how AGI capabilities and benefits are distributedn4. Potential effects on how AGI risks are managednnLet me develop a Fermi estimate focusing on expected value in terms of existential risk reduction, since this is a key EA concern with AGI.",
      "summary": "This document outlines OpenAI's vision for AGI development and distribution, emphasizing economic transformation and individual empowerment. From an EA perspective, while it addresses the potentially enormous scale of AGI's impact, it significantly understates existential risks and alignment challenges. The document presents interesting economic observations about AI scaling but lacks concrete, tractable plans for ensuring safety alongside capabilities. The proposed approach to governance emphasizes individual empowerment over centralized control, but creates a false dichotomy that neglects crucial safety considerations. The ideas for broad distribution of benefits lack implementation details and may be insufficient without addressing deeper alignment issues. Overall, the document presents an optimistic vision that acknowledges some societal challenges but inadequately addresses the most serious risks that concern the EA community.",
