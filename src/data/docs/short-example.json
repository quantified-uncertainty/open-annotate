The literature reflects this division - Bostrom's \"Superintelligence\" discusses both alignment and capability control measures, while Christiano's work focuses on intent alignment. The observation that terminology is better developed for alignment than for capability limitations is accurate and reflects a historical emphasis in the field.",

This relates to LessWrong discussions on \"legibility\" and \"transparency\" in AI systems, though these concepts are often discussed separately from capability limitations despite their natural connection.",
