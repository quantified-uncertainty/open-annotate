# Information Hazards: A Risk Framework

This document presents a framework for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating information hazards—cases where sharing or publishing information could cause harm. These hazards are increasingly relevant in an era of rapid technological and informational acceleration.

## What is an Information Hazard?

An *information hazard* is a risk that arises from the dissemination or accessibility of knowledge. While information is traditionally viewed as a public good, certain types of information may pose dangers if made widely available. This includes—but is not limited to—details that enable misuse of biotechnology, instructions for engineering pathogens, cryptographic vulnerabilities, or social coordination failures.

## Categories of Information Hazards

We identify several categories:

### 1. Technological Capability Hazards

Information that accelerates the development or implementation of potentially dangerous technologies. For instance, publishing a novel gene-editing technique might enable beneficial applications but also empower malicious actors to design harmful bioagents.

### 2. Psychological or Behavioral Hazards

Information that modifies public behavior in harmful ways. For example, widespread publication of detailed suicide methods or attention-seeking strategies associated with mass shooters could trigger copycat behavior.

### 3. Strategic or Coordination Hazards

Information that alters the strategic landscape in harmful ways—for instance, the publication of critical vulnerabilities in widely-used infrastructure before patches are available. Similarly, exposure of disinformation campaigns may help adversaries refine their tactics.

## Dual-Use Information and Risk Tradeoffs

The concept of *dual-use research of concern* (DURC) is foundational here. Much scientific and technical progress has both beneficial and harmful potential. Assessing such tradeoffs requires a structured, epistemic-risk-aware framework that incorporates both near-term and long-term impact assessments.

### Case Example: AI Capability Releases

In the domain of artificial intelligence, novel techniques such as few-shot learning or alignment-pretraining methods may significantly accelerate general capabilities. The release of code and model weights for such techniques can enable reproducibility and collaboration—but may also equip non-aligned actors with unprecedented tools.

### Case Example: Behavioral Science Insights

Recent findings in attention engineering, social manipulation, and persuasive architecture have increased platform efficiency but also raised concerns around user autonomy, addiction, and political polarization.

## Governance Recommendations

1. **Risk Forecasting**: Use foresight tools, including scenario modeling and red-teaming, to evaluate the downstream implications of knowledge release.

2. **Tiered Disclosure**: Establish graded pathways for information release (e.g., preprints, private consortia, embargoes) based on risk category.

3. **Cross-Domain Review Panels**: Encourage multidisciplinary review, including ethicists, security professionals, and technologists.

4. **Transparency Indexing**: Rather than full suppression, information hazards may be partially documented but indexed in secure, regulated archives.

## Open Challenges

- How do we ensure scientific openness while protecting against strategic misuse?
- What institutions are best positioned to evaluate and arbitrate these tradeoffs?
- How can we foster global coordination, given geopolitical tensions and cultural divergence in risk assessment?

We conclude that information hazards are a growing field of concern, meriting deeper formalization and proactive governance design.
