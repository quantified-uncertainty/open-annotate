  "content": "## Strongly Bounded AI: Definitions and Strategic Implications\n\n**Ozzie Gooen \\- April 14 2025, Draft. Quick post for the EA Forum / LessWrong.**\n\n**Also, be sure to see this post. I just found [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z5YGZwdABLChoAiHs/bounded-ai-might-be-viable), need to update this post.** \n\n**Epistemic status: Exploratory concept with moderate confidence**  \nThis represents my current thinking on a potentially valuable framing for AI safety, drawing on established engineering principles. In the last few years discussion around these topics has exploded \\- I wouldn't be surprised if there were great existing works that I don't know about and can't quickly find. \n\n— \n\nI feel the AI safety conversation lacks terminology for limited, safe, and useful AI systems that address takeover risks rather than misuse by humans. This concept goes beyond alignment to include capability restrictions, reliance on established technologies, and intelligence limitations for predictability.\n\n**On the Terminology**\n\nOne thing I feel is missing from AI safety conversations is strong and versatile terminology for limited, safe, and useful AI systems. \n\nThis concept isn't just about alignment. It's also about:\n\n* Substantial capability restrictions (using older models, strong compute limits)  \n* Exclusive use of highly-tested and well-established technologies  \n* Intelligence limitations that make behavior highly predictable\n\nI think some potential names for these systems could be:\n\n* Strongly Bounded AI  \n* Highly-Reliable AI  \n* Boring AI\n\nFor the rest of this document, I'll go with \"*Strongly Bounded AI*.\"\n\n\"Strongly Bounded AIs\" are not necessarily ones with substantial alignment or safeguards \\- but rather, AIs we can reason to not represent severe AI takeover risks. This means they can either be very weak systems (like many of the systems of today) without safeguards, or stronger systems with a much greater degree of safeguards.\n\nWe already have somewhat understood areas of \"*Control*,\" \"*Scalable Oversight*,\" etc., which approach similar ideas. But I believe these systems typically investigate \"*specific AI layers directly overseeing risky AIs*\" rather than broader AI services/agents that are doing more regular duties in the world.\n\nWe also have the fields of \"[Comprehensive AI Services](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/comprehensive-ai-services)\" (see Drexler) or [Guaranteed Safe AI](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.06624v2) (See Davidad). These are closer to the idea I'm proposing, but are more specific. I think neither is necessary for \"Strongly Bounded AI\".\n\nA \"Bounded\" AI is also arguably different from an aligned or a safe AI. Both \"aligned\" and \"safe\" at this point have fairly broad and imprecise definitions, in comparison. I'd also flag that \"Boundedness\" is really about accident risks, not mistake risks. A bad actor could use a bounded system to do significant harm. This is akin to the importance of reliability in military technology \\- such reliability is useful for the military, but obviously can still be used destructively if desired. \n\n## **Engineering Culture and Established Patterns**\n\nIn tech companies, there's an established virtue of using \"boring tech\" – Postgres, SQL, REST, etc. There's always something fancier trending on Hacker News, but these cutting-edge systems come with major uncertainties and liabilities. Typically, new programmers enthusiastically advocate for the latest JavaScript framework while experienced engineers spend time arguing for proven technologies.\n\nEngineering also features many well-understood and distinct subfields for highly-reliable systems: \"Fault-Tolerant Systems,\" \"Ultra-Reliable Systems,\" \"High-Assurance Systems,\" \"Formal Verification,\" etc. I believe these concepts effectively carve out market positions for unusually secure technology. Major software products like Microsoft Windows or Google Docs don't advertise themselves as \"Fault-Tolerant Systems\" or \"Formally Verified\" – these terms are reserved for genuinely reliability-focused systems. While these terms can function as marketing buzzwords, I think they still help establish meaningful categories.\n\n## **Current State and Future Potential**\n\nI think most AI agents today are weak and highly limited. I don't expect 99% of them could cause catastrophic damage (say, $100B in damages) anytime soon – the technology is simply too weak and expensive. I'd feel fairly comfortable using many current systems without worrying about major alignment risks.\n\nMy strong expectation is that a tremendous amount of good and global stability could come from developing \"Strongly Bounded AIs.\" And perhaps most importantly, I think the game plan should entail using \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" to help us reason about, develop, and control cutting-edge AI technologies.\n\nI believe the real AI takeover threat comes from frontier AI agents. I think the capability gap between frontier models and our controlled AI systems represents the potential damage frontier AI could cause. If it's \"a powerful malicious frontier AI agent\" versus humans alone, there's a massive potential for takeover. If it's the same agent versus \"robust, reliable and controllable AIs,\" I'd feel much better about our defensive position.\n\n## **Applications and Evolution**\n\nOver time, I think we'll develop better methods for creating \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" that push the frontier of effectiveness while maintaining safety. One of the main things we should probably do with cutting-edge AIs (to the extent we use them) is to help us create better \"Strongly Bounded AIs.\"\n\nWhat could \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" do? In my view:\n\n* Oversee personal data on devices  \n* Make strategic recommendations for organizations  \n* Secure key resources beyond traditional access management (e.g., AI monitoring bank withdrawals for signs of duress)  \n* Handle bounded high-reliability operations in medicine and defense  \n* Assist auditors examining potentially dangerous organizations/systems\n\n## **Addressing Common Questions**\n\n**\"Doesn't delegating to AI systems increase takeover risks?\"** I think this is an oversimplified view and would often argue the opposite. I'd expect that \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" could make the world much more secure against frontier adversarial AIs, not less. But of course, one would need to implement smart tradeoffs.\n\n**\"Isn't opposing frontier AI while supporting limited AI confusing?\"** I think engineering has a long history of distinguishing between safe and unsafe technologies. I don't think the difference between AI systems is unusually strange compared to previous work in reliability engineering and computer security.\n\n**\"Won't this term become meaningless marketing?\"** I'm not that cynical. I think safety-minded people should develop clear standards for safe systems, then work to form the language. We already have some terminology for highly-trustworthy technology. Even when one term gets semantically diluted due to marketing, others can emerge to take its place.",

While the overall framing attempts to be balanced, the analysis reveals several significant biases. The text exhibits status quo bias by assuming current AI systems are inherently safe, technological solutionism by overemphasizing technical fixes to complex sociotechnical problems, and authority bias through appeals to engineering culture without sufficient evidence. There's also notable in-group bias toward the EA/rationalist community and confirmation bias in selectively focusing on certain risks while downplaying others. The document scores particularly high (7-8/10) on framing bias, technological determinism, and oversimplification bias. To improve, the author should incorporate diverse perspectives from affected communities, acknowledge competing frameworks, provide empirical evidence for claims, and recognize the limitations of purely technical approaches to AI governance.",

The author positions this concept alongside existing frameworks like Control, Scalable Oversight, Comprehensive AI Services, and Guaranteed Safe AI, while distinguishing it as focused specifically on accident prevention rather than misuse. Drawing parallels to engineering culture's preference for \"boring tech\" and established reliability patterns, the post argues that current AI systems are largely bounded by their limitations, but we should deliberately develop more capable yet strongly bounded systems to help manage frontier AI risks. The author suggests applications in personal data oversight, strategic recommendations, security, medicine, defense, and auditing, while addressing potential objections about delegation risks, conceptual confusion, and terminology dilution.",

          "title": "Engineering Reliability Paradigms as Conceptual Foundation",
          "description": "The author draws a compelling parallel between established engineering reliability frameworks and the proposed \"Strongly Bounded AI\" concept. This connection to existing engineering culture isn't merely rhetorical - it reflects a deep tradition in safety-critical systems where conservatism is a virtue. The reliability engineering field has developed numerous methodologies (fault tolerance, formal verification, etc.) that could be adapted for AI safety. This parallels discussions in the AI alignment community about formal verification approaches, interpretability, and containment strategies. The reference to \"boring tech\" also echoes Nick Bostrom's concept of \"differential technological development\" where we prioritize safety-enabling technologies over potentially dangerous ones.",

          "description": "The author acknowledges K. Eric Drexler's Comprehensive AI Services (CAIS) framework but positions Strongly Bounded AI as a broader concept. This distinction is important, as CAIS represents a specific technical approach focusing on modular, specialized AI systems rather than general agents. CAIS has been discussed extensively on LessWrong and the EA Forum as an alternative to the default agent-centric AI development paradigm. The author's bounded AI concept seems to be compatible with CAIS but doesn't require its specific implementation details. This highlights an important pattern in AI safety research - the need for both specific technical implementations and broader conceptual frameworks that can accommodate multiple technical approaches.",

          "title": "Accident Risk vs. Misuse Risk Distinction",
          "description": "The author makes an important distinction between accident risks (which Strongly Bounded AI addresses) and misuse risks (which it doesn't). This mirrors a fundamental categorization in AI safety research between accidents (unintended consequences of AI systems functioning as designed) and misuse (deliberate harmful applications). The military technology analogy effectively illustrates how reliability can be orthogonal to ethical use. This distinction is critical for policy discussions, as different interventions may be required for each risk type. The EA and rationalist communities have debated the relative importance of these risk categories, with some arguing that misalignment risks from advanced AI are more severe than misuse risks due to their potential for uncontrollable cascading consequences.",

          "description": "The author challenges the simplistic view that delegating to AI systems inherently increases takeover risks, arguing instead that Strongly Bounded AIs could enhance security against frontier AI threats. This represents an important counterpoint to the common concern in AI safety that any delegation increases risk. This perspective aligns with what some call the \"competitive\" argument for safe AI development - that defensive AI systems may be necessary to protect against offensive ones. Similar arguments appear in discussions of AI governance where some argue that security-enhancing AI tools are necessary for maintaining stability in a world with increasingly powerful AI systems. This position remains controversial in the alignment community, with critics arguing that any increase in AI capability and autonomy increases overall systemic risk.",

          "description": "The author addresses concerns about terminology dilution through marketing, expressing optimism about maintaining meaningful standards. This touches on a meta-issue in AI safety discourse - the challenge of maintaining precise technical language in a field with increasing commercial interest. The EA and rationalist communities have experienced similar challenges with terms like \"alignment,\" \"safety,\" and \"AGI\" becoming less precise as they enter mainstream discourse. The author's suggestion that new terms can emerge when old ones become diluted reflects a pragmatic approach to linguistic drift. This connects to broader discussions about the importance of clear communication in technical fields and the trade-offs between accessibility and precision in terminology.",

          "title": "Capability Gap as Risk Metric",
          "description": "The author introduces a novel framing: the capability gap between frontier models and controlled AI systems represents the potential damage frontier AI could cause. This perspective offers a quantifiable way to think about AI risk reduction - narrowing this gap through more capable bounded systems could reduce overall risk. This connects to discussions about the \"alignment tax\" (the performance cost of making AI systems safe) and debates about whether alignment will naturally lag behind capabilities. The framing suggests a strategy focused not just on limiting frontier AI capabilities but also on enhancing the capabilities of controlled systems, which differs from purely restriction-focused approaches. This has parallels to discussions about differential technological development in the EA community, where accelerating certain technologies relative to others is seen as potentially risk-reducing.",

          "description": "The author suggests using cutting-edge AIs to help create better Strongly Bounded AIs, proposing a bootstrapping approach to safety. This reflects a pragmatic stance on utilizing frontier capabilities to enhance safety, rather than viewing frontier models as purely risky. This approach connects to discussions about AI-assisted alignment research and tool AI paradigms, where advanced models help solve alignment challenges. The idea has precedent in the concept of \"pivotal acts\" discussed by Eliezer Yudkowsky and others - using advanced AI capabilities to create conditions that prevent harmful AI development. However, this approach remains controversial, with critics arguing that using frontier models even for safety research introduces unnecessary risks and creates incentives for continued capability advancement.",

          "title": "Current AI Systems as Inherently Bounded",
          "description": "The author asserts that most current AI agents are inherently bounded by their technical limitations, suggesting a natural safety barrier exists in early-stage AI. This observation connects to debates about when AI systems might become dangerous - whether current systems already pose existential risks or whether such risks only emerge with significantly more advanced systems. The $100B damage threshold mentioned provides a concrete metric for evaluating risk, though some in the alignment community might argue that even current systems could potentially cause harm exceeding this threshold through sophisticated social manipulation or cybersecurity exploits. This perspective on current systems' limitations aligns with arguments from AI capabilities researchers who often emphasize the significant constraints of existing models, while contrasting with some safety researchers who worry about emergent capabilities in current systems.",

          "title": "Distinction from Alignment and Safety Concepts",
          "description": "The author distinguishes \"Boundedness\" from the broader concepts of alignment and safety, positioning it as a more precise term focused specifically on accident prevention. This taxonomical clarification is important in a field where terminology often lacks consensus definitions. The distinction highlights how \"alignment\" has become an umbrella term encompassing many different technical and philosophical approaches. This connects to ongoing discussions in the AI safety community about terminology precision - for instance, debates about whether \"alignment\" should refer to aligning AI with human values, human intentions, or human interests, each representing different technical challenges. The author's effort to carve out a more specific concept reflects a broader trend toward developing more granular and technically precise terminology in AI safety discourse.",

          "description": "The author proposes novel applications for Strongly Bounded AIs that extend beyond traditional oversight roles, including securing resources and detecting duress. This application-focused thinking connects theory to practical implementation scenarios. The suggested use cases span personal, organizational, and societal levels, indicating a comprehensive vision for how these systems might be deployed. The mention of AI systems monitoring for signs of duress particularly connects to discussions about AI tripwires and monitoring systems in the alignment community. These applications align with the concept of \"AI guardians\" or \"overseer AIs\" that have been discussed in AI governance circles, though with the important distinction that these would be bounded systems rather than superintelligent overseers. The diversity of applications suggests a broad ecosystem of safety-focused AI systems rather than a single approach.",
