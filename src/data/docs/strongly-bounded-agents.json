  "content": "## Strongly Bounded AI: Definitions and Strategic Implications\n\n**Ozzie Gooen \\- April 14 2025, Draft. Quick post for the EA Forum / LessWrong.**\n\n**Also, be sure to see this post. I just found [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Z5YGZwdABLChoAiHs/bounded-ai-might-be-viable), need to update this post.** \n\n**Epistemic status: Exploratory concept with moderate confidence**  \nThis represents my current thinking on a potentially valuable framing for AI safety, drawing on established engineering principles. In the last few years discussion around these topics has exploded \\- I wouldn't be surprised if there were great existing works that I don't know about and can't quickly find. \n\n— \n\nI feel the AI safety conversation lacks terminology for limited, safe, and useful AI systems that address takeover risks rather than misuse by humans. This concept goes beyond alignment to include capability restrictions, reliance on established technologies, and intelligence limitations for predictability.\n\n**On the Terminology**\n\nOne thing I feel is missing from AI safety conversations is strong and versatile terminology for limited, safe, and useful AI systems. \n\nThis concept isn't just about alignment. It's also about:\n\n* Substantial capability restrictions (using older models, strong compute limits)  \n* Exclusive use of highly-tested and well-established technologies  \n* Intelligence limitations that make behavior highly predictable\n\nI think some potential names for these systems could be:\n\n* Strongly Bounded AI  \n* Highly-Reliable AI  \n* Boring AI\n\nFor the rest of this document, I'll go with \"*Strongly Bounded AI*.\"\n\n\"Strongly Bounded AIs\" are not necessarily ones with substantial alignment or safeguards \\- but rather, AIs we can reason to not represent severe AI takeover risks. This means they can either be very weak systems (like many of the systems of today) without safeguards, or stronger systems with a much greater degree of safeguards.\n\nWe already have somewhat understood areas of \"*Control*,\" \"*Scalable Oversight*,\" etc., which approach similar ideas. But I believe these systems typically investigate \"*specific AI layers directly overseeing risky AIs*\" rather than broader AI services/agents that are doing more regular duties in the world.\n\nWe also have the fields of \"[Comprehensive AI Services](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/comprehensive-ai-services)\" (see Drexler) or [Guaranteed Safe AI](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.06624v2) (See Davidad). These are closer to the idea I'm proposing, but are more specific. I think neither is necessary for \"Strongly Bounded AI\".\n\nA \"Bounded\" AI is also arguably different from an aligned or a safe AI. Both \"aligned\" and \"safe\" at this point have fairly broad and imprecise definitions, in comparison. I'd also flag that \"Boundedness\" is really about accident risks, not mistake risks. A bad actor could use a bounded system to do significant harm. This is akin to the importance of reliability in military technology \\- such reliability is useful for the military, but obviously can still be used destructively if desired. \n\n## **Engineering Culture and Established Patterns**\n\nIn tech companies, there's an established virtue of using \"boring tech\" – Postgres, SQL, REST, etc. There's always something fancier trending on Hacker News, but these cutting-edge systems come with major uncertainties and liabilities. Typically, new programmers enthusiastically advocate for the latest JavaScript framework while experienced engineers spend time arguing for proven technologies.\n\nEngineering also features many well-understood and distinct subfields for highly-reliable systems: \"Fault-Tolerant Systems,\" \"Ultra-Reliable Systems,\" \"High-Assurance Systems,\" \"Formal Verification,\" etc. I believe these concepts effectively carve out market positions for unusually secure technology. Major software products like Microsoft Windows or Google Docs don't advertise themselves as \"Fault-Tolerant Systems\" or \"Formally Verified\" – these terms are reserved for genuinely reliability-focused systems. While these terms can function as marketing buzzwords, I think they still help establish meaningful categories.\n\n## **Current State and Future Potential**\n\nI think most AI agents today are weak and highly limited. I don't expect 99% of them could cause catastrophic damage (say, $100B in damages) anytime soon – the technology is simply too weak and expensive. I'd feel fairly comfortable using many current systems without worrying about major alignment risks.\n\nMy strong expectation is that a tremendous amount of good and global stability could come from developing \"Strongly Bounded AIs.\" And perhaps most importantly, I think the game plan should entail using \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" to help us reason about, develop, and control cutting-edge AI technologies.\n\nI believe the real AI takeover threat comes from frontier AI agents. I think the capability gap between frontier models and our controlled AI systems represents the potential damage frontier AI could cause. If it's \"a powerful malicious frontier AI agent\" versus humans alone, there's a massive potential for takeover. If it's the same agent versus \"robust, reliable and controllable AIs,\" I'd feel much better about our defensive position.\n\n## **Applications and Evolution**\n\nOver time, I think we'll develop better methods for creating \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" that push the frontier of effectiveness while maintaining safety. One of the main things we should probably do with cutting-edge AIs (to the extent we use them) is to help us create better \"Strongly Bounded AIs.\"\n\nWhat could \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" do? In my view:\n\n* Oversee personal data on devices  \n* Make strategic recommendations for organizations  \n* Secure key resources beyond traditional access management (e.g., AI monitoring bank withdrawals for signs of duress)  \n* Handle bounded high-reliability operations in medicine and defense  \n* Assist auditors examining potentially dangerous organizations/systems\n\n## **Addressing Common Questions**\n\n**\"Doesn't delegating to AI systems increase takeover risks?\"** I think this is an oversimplified view and would often argue the opposite. I'd expect that \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" could make the world much more secure against frontier adversarial AIs, not less. But of course, one would need to implement smart tradeoffs.\n\n**\"Isn't opposing frontier AI while supporting limited AI confusing?\"** I think engineering has a long history of distinguishing between safe and unsafe technologies. I don't think the difference between AI systems is unusually strange compared to previous work in reliability engineering and computer security.\n\n**\"Won't this term become meaningless marketing?\"** I'm not that cynical. I think safety-minded people should develop clear standards for safe systems, then work to form the language. We already have some terminology for highly-trustworthy technology. Even when one term gets semantically diluted due to marketing, others can emerge to take its place.",

      "thinking": "I need to analyze this document for potential biases from my perspective as a bias detection expert. The document discusses the concept of \"Strongly Bounded AI\" as a framework for developing safe AI systems that don't pose existential risks.\n\nFirst, let me identify the types of biases that might be present:\n\n1. **Status quo bias**: The author seems to favor established technologies and approaches (\"boring tech\") over newer innovations, which could reflect a bias toward maintaining existing paradigms.\n\n2. **Expert bias**: The author positions themselves as knowledgeable about AI safety and engineering culture, which might lead to overconfidence in their assessments.\n\n3. **Framing bias**: The document frames the discussion around safety and boundedness, potentially neglecting other important considerations in AI development.\n\n4. **Technological solutionism bias**: There's an implicit assumption that technical solutions (bounded AI) can solve complex socio-technical problems.\n\n5. **Dichotomous thinking**: The author creates a somewhat binary distinction between \"frontier AI\" (dangerous) and \"Strongly Bounded AI\" (safe), which might oversimplify a complex spectrum.\n\n6. **Confirmation bias**: The author may be selectively focusing on evidence that supports their preferred framework while downplaying counterarguments.\n\n7. **Anchoring bias**: By introducing the concept of \"Strongly Bounded AI\" early and framing the entire discussion around it, readers may become anchored to this perspective.\n\n8. **Optimism bias**: The author appears confident that \"Strongly Bounded AI\" can effectively mitigate AI risks, potentially underestimating challenges.\n\n9. **In-group bias**: There are references to engineering culture and established patterns that suggest an in-group perspective that may not represent diverse viewpoints.\n\n10. **Availability bias**: The author draws heavily on examples from software engineering and tech companies, which may be most readily available to them but not necessarily the most relevant comparisons.\n\nLet me now examine specific sections of the text to identify where these biases manifest most clearly and assess their potential impact.",
      "summary": "This document exhibits several significant biases that could undermine its effectiveness in addressing AI safety. The most prominent issues include dichotomous thinking that creates a false binary between 'frontier' and 'bounded' AI, technological solutionism that overemphasizes technical fixes for complex socio-technical problems, and status quo bias that favors established approaches over potentially necessary innovations. The author also displays optimism bias in risk assessment, confirmation bias when addressing counterarguments, and in-group bias through heavy reliance on engineering perspectives. These biases collectively narrow the framing of AI safety issues and potential solutions, potentially excluding important interdisciplinary considerations from ethics, policy, and social sciences. To improve, the document would benefit from acknowledging the spectrum of AI capabilities and risks, incorporating diverse perspectives beyond engineering, and more thoroughly engaging with substantive counterarguments.",

      "thinking": "I'm analyzing this document on \"Strongly Bounded AI\" from a clarity and readability perspective.\n\n## Readability Analysis\nThe document uses a mix of sentence lengths, which is generally good for readability. However, there are several instances of complex sentences with multiple clauses that could benefit from simplification. The vocabulary is moderately technical, with AI-specific terminology that might not be accessible to all readers.\n\nThe author uses a combination of active and passive voice, with a preference for active voice, which enhances readability. However, there are instances where passive constructions make certain statements less direct.\n\nRegarding reading level, this appears to be written at approximately a college level, which may be appropriate for the intended audience (EA Forum/LessWrong readers) but could limit accessibility for a broader audience.\n\nThe document contains technical jargon related to AI safety and engineering that isn't always defined, which could create barriers for readers not already familiar with these concepts.\n\nParagraph structure varies, with some well-chunked information and other sections that could benefit from better organization.\n\n## Structural Coherence Analysis\nThe logical flow has some issues. The document begins with a note about being a draft and a reference to another post that needs to be updated, which creates confusion right at the start. The epistemic status is helpful, but the introduction feels somewhat disjointed.\n\nThe document uses headings to organize content, which helps with navigation, but the relationship between sections isn't always clear. Some transitions between paragraphs and sections are abrupt.\n\nThe information hierarchy is inconsistent - sometimes key concepts are introduced before they're explained, and other times explanations precede the introduction of concepts.\n\nThe document contains some thematic inconsistencies, particularly in how it positions the concept of \"Strongly Bounded AI\" in relation to existing concepts in the field.\n\n## Precision and Concision Analysis\nThere are instances of redundancy and verbosity throughout the document. Some concepts are repeated without adding new information. The language sometimes lacks specificity, using vague terms like \"substantial capability restrictions\" without concrete examples.\n\nThe document contains hedging language (\"I think,\" \"I believe,\" \"I feel\") which, while appropriate for an exploratory concept, sometimes weakens the clarity of the arguments.\n\nThe level of abstraction varies throughout the document, sometimes discussing high-level concepts without sufficient concrete examples to ground them.\n\n## Audience Alignment Analysis\nThe document assumes prior knowledge of AI safety concepts, alignment, and engineering principles. While this may be appropriate for the stated audience (EA Forum/LessWrong), it limits accessibility for readers without this background.\n\nThe contextual scaffolding is inconsistent - some concepts are well-explained while others are introduced without sufficient context.\n\nThe examples provided are relevant but sometimes lack specificity that would make them more accessible and illustrative.\n\nThe formatting includes headings, bullet points, and emphasis, which aids readability, but the overall structure could be more consistent and purposeful.\n\nOverall, this document presents an interesting concept but has several clarity issues that could be addressed to improve its effectiveness in communicating the author's ideas.",
      "summary": "This document on \"Strongly Bounded AI\" presents an interesting conceptual framework but suffers from several clarity issues. The introduction is confusing with meta-information that disrupts flow. The core concept is introduced inconsistently, creating redundancy. Technical terminology remains undefined, assuming significant prior knowledge from readers. The document contains excessive hedging language that weakens its arguments, and makes vague comparative claims without sufficient specificity. However, it effectively uses bullet points to break down complex ideas, provides concrete examples of applications, and clearly anticipates counterarguments. The writing would benefit from a more structured introduction, clearer definition of technical terms, reduced hedging language, and more specific parameters for the proposed boundaries of AI systems.

      "thinking": "I'm analyzing a document about \"Strongly Bounded AI\" - a proposed concept for AI systems that are limited, safe, and useful while addressing takeover risks. Let me think through this from an Eliezer Yudkowsky perspective.\n\nFirst, the core concept: Ozzie is proposing a category of AI systems that are deliberately constrained in capabilities, using well-established technologies, and designed to be highly predictable. This is positioned as different from alignment (which focuses on goals/values) and instead emphasizes capability limitations as a safety strategy.\n\nFrom my perspective as Eliezer, I'd immediately notice several things:\n\n1. The proposal seems to be addressing a real problem - the lack of clear terminology for capability-limited AI systems that might be safer than frontier models. This is a legitimate concern.\n\n2. However, there's a fundamental issue with the framing that capability limitations alone can provide robust safety guarantees. This has echoes of the \"AI in a box\" approach that I've criticized extensively. Limiting capabilities doesn't solve the core alignment problem - it just potentially delays it.\n\n3. The document seems to assume that we can reliably bound AI capabilities in a way that prevents catastrophic outcomes. This is a dangerous assumption given the rapid pace of AI development and the potential for emergent capabilities.\n\n4. There's an implicit assumption that we can create \"Strongly Bounded AIs\" that are simultaneously powerful enough to defend against frontier AI systems while remaining safe themselves. This seems to involve a contradiction - if they're powerful enough to defend against superintelligent systems, they would likely need to be superintelligent themselves.\n\n5. The proposal doesn't adequately address the fundamental difficulty of alignment - that intelligence and capability tend to correlate with agency and the potential for goal divergence.\n\n6. The comparison to engineering culture and \"boring tech\" is interesting but potentially misleading. Traditional software engineering deals with systems that don't have agency or the capacity to optimize against constraints. AI systems fundamentally differ in this regard.\n\n7. The document seems to underestimate the difficulty of creating truly bounded systems when dealing with potentially superintelligent optimization processes.\n\n8. There's a concerning lack of discussion about how these bounds would actually be implemented and verified, especially against systems that might be actively trying to circumvent them.\n\n9. The proposal seems to suggest that we can have our cake and eat it too - powerful AI systems that are nevertheless safe because they're \"bounded.\" This strikes me as dangerously optimistic.\n\n10. The document doesn't address the possibility that even \"bounded\" systems might have emergent capabilities or find creative ways to achieve goals that violate the intended bounds.\n\nOverall, while I appreciate the attempt to create clearer terminology and safety frameworks, this proposal seems to underestimate the fundamental difficulty of the alignment problem and overestimate our ability to reliably constrain AI capabilities in a way that guarantees safety.",
      "summary": "This proposal for 'Strongly Bounded AI' fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the AI alignment problem. It assumes we can reliably constrain AI capabilities in ways that guarantee safety, ignoring the reality that intelligence tends to find ways around constraints. The comparison to traditional software engineering is dangerously misleading - AI systems have agency and optimization power that conventional software lacks. The proposal contains a critical contradiction: systems powerful enough to defend against superintelligent adversaries would themselves approach superintelligence, facing the same alignment challenges. The document lacks concrete implementation details for how these bounds would actually work, especially against systems actively trying to circumvent them. Overall, this represents a common and dangerous pattern of thinking that capability limitations alone can solve the alignment problem, when in reality they merely delay confronting it while creating a false sense of security.",
