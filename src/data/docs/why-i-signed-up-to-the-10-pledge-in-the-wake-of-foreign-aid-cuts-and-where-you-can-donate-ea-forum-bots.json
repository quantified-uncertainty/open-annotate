PMI (President’s Malaria Initiative) is estimated to have saved [more than 10 million lives](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/154755/cdc_154755_DS1.pdf) through malaria prevention and treatment.\n*   The US aid freeze beginning in January led to the abrupt shutdown of many global health programs. They meant that, for example, [hundreds of thousands of people lost access to HIV treatment each day](https://www.amfar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Impact-of-Stop-Work-Orders-for-PEPFAR-Programs-2.pdf), and that [more than 1,000 additional newborns were contracting HIV daily](https://www.amfar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Impact-of-Stop-Work-Orders-for-PEPFAR-Programs-2.pdf) because HIV-positive mothers lost access to treatment.\n*   Charles Kenny and Justin Sandefur have [estimated](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/how-many-lives-does-us-foreign-aid-save) that a complete aid freeze would result in around 6,000 additional deaths per day, or 3.3 million over a year.\n*   On March 10, the Trump administration terminated [more than 86% of foreign aid awards](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-usaid-list-of-terminated-global-health-awards-what-does-it-tell-us/) after a \"90 day review\" that ended in 35 days – meaning about one award was terminated roughly every 80 seconds.\n*   Courts ruled some aid cuts were illegal, compelling the administration to resume about $2 billion in funding.\n*   Still, it seems that about a quarter of HIV program funding has been permanently terminated, along with around 83% of funding for maternal and child health programs, 40% for malaria, 90% for pandemic influenza and other emerging threats, and 56% for water supply and sanitation. ([source](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/usaid-cuts-little-sign-mercy-life-saving-health-programs))\n*   The Demographic and Health Surveys was also [terminated](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/health/usaid-global-health-surveys.html) — this is critical because it's the only source of good data on mortality, nutrition, and other areas in many poor countries.\n*   The US also withdrew all their funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps vaccinate millions of children against diseases like polio, measles, diphtheria, and cervical cancer in low-income countries. It was previously their largest donor ([at 12%](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-gavi-the-vaccine-alliance/)).\n*   Since [thousands of USAID staff were laid off](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usaid-missions-overseas-ordered-shutdown-by-friday/), even those programs whose funding was restored are still disrupted. Both USAID’s [main website](https://www.usaid.gov/) and [PEPFAR’s data portal](https://data.pepfar.gov/) are still unavailable.\n*   The cuts have threatened not just short-term services but also years of built-up expertise, infrastructure, and institutional capacity. Once lost, these are difficult to rebuild and could set back global health progress in the long-term.\n\n**Here is a brief list of some of the places you could donate:**\n\n*   [**GiveWell**](https://www.givewell.org/) – A nonprofit that identifies and recommends some of the most cost-effective, evidence-based charities in global health. In response to the aid cuts, [they’ve prioritized filling urgent funding gaps](https://www.givewell.org/research/funding-cuts) in malaria prevention, HIV testing, and healthcare worker training.\n*   [**Project Resource Optimization**](https://proimpact.tools/) **–** A team of researchers and cost-effectiveness analysts who built a live list of high-impact USAID-funded programs affected by the aid freeze. They’re talking regularly with implementing partners to identify the most urgent and cost-effective projects at risk of shutting down. On their ‘[funding opportunities](https://proimpact.tools/funding-opps)’ page, you can find programs directly affected and donate to them directly, or contact the research team for more information.\n*   [**Foreign Aid Bridge Fund**](https://www.foreignaidbridgefund.org/) **–** An emergency philanthropic fund created to support lifesaving programs suddenly defunded by the foreign aid freeze. It focuses on bridging short-term gaps to prevent program collapse, such as HIV clinics in Kenya and Zimbabwe, health programs in Ethiopia, and disaster-resilient housing in Nepal.\n*   [**Rapid Response Fund**](https://www.founderspledge.com/funds/rapid-response-fund) **–** Another emergency philanthropic fund launched by Founders Pledge and The Life You Can Save to quickly support top-rated global health and poverty programs facing sudden shortfalls. It provides emergency funding to keep high-impact interventions running during the aid cuts.\n*   [**Gavi**](https://www.gavi.org/donate?gad_source=1) **–** A public-private global health partnership that provides vaccines to millions of children in low-income countries. The US withdrew all their funding for Gavi, putting global vaccination campaigns at risk.",

      "thinking": "I need to analyze this document for potential biases. The text appears to be a linkpost about foreign aid cuts in the US and the author's personal response to donate a significant portion of their income. Let me examine this carefully for various types of biases.\n\n1. First, I'll consider the overall framing of the document. It presents a clear narrative about US foreign aid cuts and their negative consequences, followed by suggestions for donations. The framing is decidedly one-sided, focusing exclusively on the negative impacts of aid cuts without presenting any potential counterarguments or reasons why these cuts might have been implemented.\n\n2. The document uses emotional language (\"horror unfold\", \"abrupt shutdown\") which may appeal to emotional reasoning rather than purely rational analysis.\n\n3. The statistics presented appear to be from reputable sources, but they are selectively chosen to emphasize the negative impacts. There's no discussion of potential inefficiencies, corruption, or other criticisms that might exist regarding foreign aid programs.\n\n4. The author presents their personal decision to donate 19% of their income as a response, which could create social pressure or an anchoring effect for readers.\n\n5. The list of donation options is presented without a critical analysis of their relative effectiveness or potential drawbacks.\n\n6. There's an implicit assumption throughout that foreign aid is unequivocally good and that private donations can effectively replace government funding, which may oversimplify complex development economics issues.\n\n7. The document doesn't acknowledge potential political perspectives that might support reduced foreign aid in favor of domestic spending priorities.\n\n8. There's no discussion of potential unintended consequences of foreign aid or dependency issues that some economists have raised.\n\nSpecific biases I'm detecting:\n- Confirmation bias: The document only presents information that confirms the view that foreign aid cuts are harmful.\n- Appeal to emotion: Using phrases like \"horror unfold\" to elicit emotional rather than rational responses.\n- Availability heuristic: Focusing on vivid, immediate impacts (\"hundreds of thousands of people lost access to HIV treatment each day\") without balanced long-term analysis.\n- In-group bias: The framing suggests an in-group of people who care about global health and an out-group who don't.\n- Authority bias: Relying on statistics from authorities without critical examination.\n- Omission bias: Focusing on harms of action (cutting aid) while not addressing potential harms of inaction (continuing potentially inefficient programs).\n- Bandwagon effect: Implicitly suggesting readers should join the author in donating.\n\nNow I'll formulate specific comments based on these observations.",
      "summary": "The document exhibits several significant biases that could impair balanced decision-making. It presents a one-sided narrative about foreign aid cuts without acknowledging counterarguments or potential criticisms of aid effectiveness. The use of emotional language may bypass critical thinking, while the prominent mention of the author's 19% donation creates an anchoring effect that could influence readers' giving decisions. The document demonstrates omission bias by focusing exclusively on harms from cutting aid without addressing potential issues with existing aid programs. Additionally, donation options are presented uncritically without comparative analysis of their effectiveness. These biases collectively create a narrative that may lead readers to make decisions based on incomplete information and emotional reactions rather than balanced consideration of complex global development issues.",

The author has personally responded by pledging 19% of their income and is encouraging others to donate to specific organizations to help fill the gaps.\n\nAs Research Scholar, I should identify high-quality resources that provide:\n1. More detailed information about the impact of these aid cuts\n2. Evidence for the effectiveness of the mentioned programs\n3. Research on the organizations suggested for donations\n4. Additional context on foreign aid effectiveness\n5. Alternative perspectives or solutions\n\nI'll need to find academic papers, reports, blog posts, and other authoritative sources that directly relate to the topics mentioned. For each highlighted section, I should connect specific references that enhance understanding.\n\nThe document contains several claims with citations, which is good, but I should verify these sources and potentially find additional supporting evidence. I should also look for resources that help readers understand the broader context of foreign aid effectiveness and the specific organizations mentioned for donations.\n\nThe most important sections to highlight include:\n1. The statistics about lives saved by programs like PEPFAR and PMI\n2. The specific impacts of the aid cuts (e.g., HIV treatment access, maternal health)\n3. The estimates of additional deaths resulting from aid cuts\n4. Information about the organizations recommended for donations\n\nI'll need to find resources that both support these claims and provide additional context or nuance. I should also look for resources that discuss the effectiveness of private donations in filling gaps left by government aid cuts.",
