  "content": "Žižek is Wrong (Again)\n\nReality is not Incomplete, it is Hyper-complete\n\nWith modern quantum physics, the great metaphysical split between philosophy and natural science is almost undeniably coming full circle. In a reversal, the very questions that once separated physics from critical and transcendental philosophy now seem to unite them: Can an object be defined in isolation? Is the position of the observer inscribed in the substantial world itself? Can the material world form a coherent, unified totality? These are the problems of physics today, and yet they have also been the problems of philosophy for around 200 years.\n\nIn 1991, Deleuze and Guattari saw an ally in physics when confronted with the question: What is Philosophy? Their use of physics was to extract models of chaos, of continuously varying virtual objects, and of an infinite multiplicity of abstracted intensities, which might point philosophy in a new direction. For Deleuze and Guattari, natural science provided possible horizons—new models of thought—which philosophy could appropriate and develop. This is radically different from what the development of quantum physics implies for the history (not the future) of philosophy. The problem of reinterpreting the history of philosophy according to contemporary epistemes is, if anything, where Slavoj Žižek sees his role: it is not about what physics means for philosophy, but about what philosophy means for physics. Unfortunately, Žižek’s method of reading modern science into philosophy—specifically into Hegel and occasionally into Lacan—goes astray almost immediately.\n\nSince the publication of the Phenomenology of Spirit, it seemed Hegel at once needed rescuing. No sooner was the foundation of dialectical idealism laid than Hegel began being misinterpreted as some mystical obscurantist or simple evolutionary philosopher of endless antitheses and syntheses. Several figures, including Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Alexandre Kojève, and the anti-Hegelian avatars of French Theory, contributed to a perpetual misreading of the rigorous processes of Hegel’s Phenomenology and Logic. With Badiou, Žižek, Jameson, and the Ljubljana School more generally, however, Hegel was re-situated as an anti-teleological thinker of ontological paradoxes par excellence.\n\nOf all three, Žižek’s reading of Hegel—the same reading which allows him to recognize Hegel’s greatest accomplices as Lacan and quantum mechanics—is the most straightforward: reality is ontologically incomplete. Yet it is exactly this conclusion which seems to betray Hegel, Lacan, and quantum physics. These ontological systems are not incomplete; they are what I would call hyper-complete: they are structured by conceptual systems that are in a perpetual overestimation, or non-identity, with themselves, and from this they produce indeterminate excesses that are entirely superordinate to the very planes on which they operate. In other words, if Hegel and quantum physics stand for anything, it is not incompleteness, but (as I will argue) the complex position of an indeterminacy that presupposes a determined, yet self-contradictory, totality.\n\nHyper-completeness, not Incompleteness\n\nAs I mentioned in Part 1 of my disagreements with Žižek, in Less Than Nothing—an otherwise impressive and monumental piece of theory—Žižek’s uniting theme across Hegel, Lacan, and quantum mechanics is that epistemological insufficiency is in fact ontological incompleteness. In other words, our inability to effectively and totally know an objective reality—no matter what experimental apparatus we use—reveals an incompleteness located in reality itself. But is a systematic, ontological ‘incompleteness’ really the red thread from Hegel to quantum physics? This conclusion seems to not only depart from all three, but to miss the more interesting conclusion: that Hegel, Lacan, and quantum mechanics furnish a far more perplexing hyper-completeness of reality. Their totalizing, logical functions contradict themselves and furnish qualitatively irreducible contradictions. This abruptness to Žižek’s positions is also what forces him to prematurely dismiss figures such as Jung, Heidegger, or Nietzsche, whom I would generally defend alongside Lacan and Hegel.\n\nFor Jung (as I am arguing in an upcoming essay for Psychoanalytic Dialogues), the collective unconscious and its archetypes are superordinate abstractions derived by the contingent, everyday structure of consciousness. The mythological archetypes are the ‘exceptions’ produced by the finite imperfections of consciousness that consciousness itself is unable to account for. The archetypal position is not what is left incomplete in human consciousness, but what is all too human, and even hyper-human, in human consciousness. For Nietzsche, similarly, the all-too-human is not a subordinate incompleteness, but a topographically higher mode of human drive. The will to power, for example, is a dizzying departure from nature, rather than a remnant of humanity’s natural ground. It expresses a human impulse that humanity itself fails to coherently assimilate. Madness is, for Nietzsche, therefore more rational than sanity itself.\n\nWe see a similar avowal with Lacan, where the same superordinate position can be ascribed to the Real. The Real is not a simple remainder of the process of symbolization, an abnormal x that forever fails to find its place in the Symbolic (which is how Žižek describes it in The Sublime Object of Ideology). This view of the Real implies that the Symbolic is a consistent totality—yet if Lacan insists on anything, it is that the Symbolic, or language, is irreconcilable with itself. It produces enigmas and contradictions that are only possible because language is already there, and inevitably fails to account for its own consequences. Hence why language indefinitely displaces its own implications in the register of the (always absent) big Other.\n\nThe Real is for Lacan a distortion of the Symbolic that is produced by the Symbolic itself. Much like rules can’t be broken if the game itself is thrown away, if the Symbolic is taken away, so is the Real. To put it in a slightly awkward way, the Real is more Symbolic than the Symbolic itself, since it is the culmination of the inconsistent logic of the Symbolic.\n\nThe important point is that the Symbolic is not incomplete, and the Real does not reflect this incompleteness. The efficiency of the Symbolic actually exceeds its own comprehension. It generates infinite complexities that it cannot fully account for, and it is here that the Real emerges. The Real is thus a symptom of the hyper-completeness of an unstable Symbolic structure—it testifies that there is much more to be said about the Symbolic than about whatever preceded it, and much more to know about the Symbolic than the Symbolic can know of itself.\n\nWith Hegel—whom Žižek relies on even more than Lacan—the notion of ‘incompleteness’ is equally inadequate. The interpretation of Hegel as anti-teleological is correct: Hegel does not claim that Spirit is moving toward a final point where everything is known and predicted. Instead, absolute knowledge is an acknowledgment of radical openness and infinite formal possibilities, constructed by a conceptual knowledge that presupposes only itself. What stands out in Hegel’s system is not incompleteness that leaves determinacy open, but the indeterminacy that arises from determinacy itself.\n\nA straightforward view of Hegel’s Science of Logic traces a path from indeterminacy, to determinate being or existence, to essence, and finally to the concept. But this misses the retroactive effect of the concept on its own ground. Indeterminacy is not a prerequisite for determinacy, but a function of it—it is the indeterminate core of any determined being that allows it to be framed as its own opposite. This is why Hegel insists that his Doctrine of Being can begin either with Being or with Nothing: the negation of being is a feature of being itself. Being presupposes what it cannot account for; it exists only by incorporating the discrepancy that remains irreducible to itself. From another perspective, nothing negates itself to produce a being other than itself, continually presupposing nothing as the mode in which existence is expressed. It is not incompleteness, but conceptual indeterminacy, that drives Hegel’s Logic toward the Concept. What escapes the Concept is not its incompleteness, but the indeterminate excess for which the Concept itself is responsible.\n\nThe famous Hegelian idea that substance appears as subject, and in doing so reconstructs substance as presupposing its own (subjective) disparity toward itself, does not mean—as Žižek seems to imply—that substance or ontological reality is merely incomplete. Rather, it means that it has an indeterminate affinity to what it cannot account for: the subjective position inscribed within the a-subjective. The shift from incompleteness to indeterminacy is also relevant in quantum physics. Insisting on an a priori incompleteness in the subatomic structure of the world misses what Leonard Susskind describes as a production of indeterminacy in quantum states. Whether we argue that consciousness is incalculable, or that observation internally determines the observed, the crux of quantum entanglement is indeterminacy. For example, aligning a measurement apparatus with possible values of a quantum property like spin will influence the values observed. There is something there to be measured, but for it to be there, it must produce an indeterminacy regarding its own probabilities.\n\nEmphasizing indeterminacy over incompleteness may seem minor, but it is a crucial distinction. Incompleteness suggests that reality’s problems are subordinate, a simple failure or gap. Indeterminacy, however, means that reality is too complete for its own good—it is all too real. Just as the Lacanian Real is not simply what is left out of symbolization, but a disorienting, self-contradictory augmentation of the Symbolic’s paradoxical effects, Hegel’s ontology—like Nietzsche’s will to power, Heidegger’s being-in-the-world, or Jung’s collective unconscious—begins from a superordinate, all-too-real indeterminacy: a hyper-completeness that leaves the world fundamentally irreconcilable to itself. Hegelian ontology is not simply an incomplete contingency that assimilates its own incompleteness. It is a system that realizes itself by departing from itself, by generating the very indeterminacy that can be articulated only at a self-reflective distance. Žižek mistakenly insists on incompleteness, the less interesting counterpart to the paradoxical function of indeterminacy, and this leads him to an understanding of God that misses the very abnormality about God that God misses about Himself.\n\nGod as a Middle-Management Bureaucrat\n\nIn the spirit of Schelling, Žižek reformulates God to elaborate his ontological position. Unlike Schelling, who uses God as an impersonal embodiment of rationality in Naturphilosophie, Žižek’s use of God to explain ‘ontological incompleteness’ is brief: God is a lazy programmer who could not be bothered to create an absolutely complete reality, and the ‘holes’ in reality are now being revealed by quantum physics.\n\nBut if what remains is not incompleteness but an unnameable, hyper-complete indeterminacy, then God is not so much lazy as reckless. Recklessness, after all, requires more energy than laziness, and the world’s superordinate discrepancies can only be explained by an irresponsible overinvestment rather than a lazy underinvestment.\n\nThis unregulated excess of activity defines Schelling’s God, and it is this feature that Žižek’s lazy God misses. Schelling’s God constitutes Himself through an auto-generative capacity to negate His own infinite negative contraction into nothingness. God posits Himself as the very origin from which He emerges as a systematic feature of reality. As Schelling’s Die Weltalter argues, God posits Himself as preceding His own existence, as the possibility of His own past. God is thus forced to insert a disparity, a retroactive void, between Himself and His own emergence. This is where the idea of the extra-divine in the divine itself comes from. What is most central to God is precisely what cannot be subsumed by God. Schelling’s rational God is therefore in excess of Himself: not incomplete, but more God than God. Žižek’s reading of God as lazy is therefore misguided.\n\nGod is not simply a lazy programmer—He is an irresponsible automaton. If God is anything, He is like a late capitalist managerial figure who confidently represents an economic process that He cannot himself understand or account for. The reality furnished by God produces an endless series of antagonisms—He is the signpost of a system (like decentralized post-Fordist capitalism) so automated that it cannot keep up with its own consequences. God’s political economy is not incomplete, but hyper-complete: its totality extends beyond itself into a purely virtual discrepancy. Žižek’s suggestion that reality is incomplete—and the theological, Hegelian, Lacanian, and physical correlates of this idea—misses what is most evident about these systems.\n\nThere is no inherent gap that always remains to be filled; rather, there is a higher-order discrepancy—a productive consequence that cannot be fully re-assimilated. Reality, in other words, is far too real for reality itself to make sense of.",

      "thinking": "As Clarity Coach, my primary focus is on how effectively the author communicates complex philosophical ideas to a likely educated but non-specialist audience. This piece engages with dense topics—Hegelian dialectics, Lacanian psychoanalysis, quantum physics, and theological metaphors—requiring careful attention to readability, structural coherence, precision, and audience alignment.\n\nFirst, I must assess readability: Are sentences varied in length and structure, or do they tend toward unwieldy complexity? Is the vocabulary accessible, or does jargon impede understanding? Are technical terms explained or assumed? Next, I consider structural coherence: Does the argument progress logically, with clear transitions and signposting? Are sections and paragraphs organized to facilitate comprehension, or does the text meander? For precision and concision, I look for word economy, avoidance of redundancy, and specificity of language. Is the author verbose, or do they communicate ideas efficiently? Are concepts expressed with appropriate abstraction, or is there unnecessary circumlocution? Finally, audience alignment: Does the author scaffold context for readers unfamiliar with the philosophical canon? Are examples and metaphors accessible? Is the tone and format appropriate for a Substack audience likely interested in critical theory but not necessarily experts?\n\nGiven the subject matter, some complexity is warranted, but the challenge is to balance necessary nuance with clarity. I will pay special attention to passages where the author introduces or critiques key concepts (e.g., 'hyper-completeness' vs. 'incompleteness'), as these are pivotal for reader understanding. I will also note where the text risks alienating readers through density or lack of explanation. My comments will highlight both strengths (e.g., effective analogies, clear transitions) and weaknesses (e.g., jargon overload, convoluted sentences), providing actionable recommendations for improvement. I will use concrete examples from the text to illustrate my points, and my summary will synthesize these findings into a concise evaluation.",
      "summary": "This essay demonstrates strong conceptual precision and logical structure in critiquing Žižek's interpretation of Hegel, Lacan, and quantum physics. The author excels at distinguishing nuanced philosophical concepts (e.g., 'incompleteness' vs. 'indeterminacy') and employs effective analogies (such as the 'God as a bureaucrat' metaphor) to enhance accessibility. However, the text's readability is hampered by long, complex sentences, dense jargon, and occasional verbosity. While the intended audience may be familiar with critical theory, the lack of contextual scaffolding and explanation of technical terms risks alienating less expert readers. Structural coherence is generally strong, but readability and audience alignment could be improved through shorter sentences, clearer definitions, and more explicit signposting. Overall, the essay is intellectually rigorous but could be made more accessible without sacrificing depth.",

These ontological systems are not incomplete; they are what I would call hyper-complete: they are structured by conceptual systems that are in a perpetual overestimation, or non-identity, with themselves, and from this they produce indeterminate excesses that are entirely superordinate to the very planes on which they operate. In other words, if Hegel and quantum physics stand for anything, it is not incompleteness, but (as I will argue) the complex position of an indeterminacy that presupposes a determined, yet self-contradictory, totality."

The Real is not a simple remainder of the process of symbolization, an abnormal x that forever fails to find its place in the Symbolic (which is how Žižek describes it in The Sublime Object of Ideology). This view of the Real implies that the Symbolic is a consistent totality—yet if Lacan insists on anything, it is that the Symbolic, or language, is irreconcilable with itself. It produces enigmas and contradictions that are only possible because language is already there, and inevitably fails to account for its own consequences. Hence why language indefinitely displaces its own implications in the register of the (always absent) big Other.\n\nThe Real is for Lacan a distortion of the Symbolic that is produced by the Symbolic itself. Much like rules can’t be broken if the game itself is thrown away, if the Symbolic is taken away, so is the Real. To put it in a slightly awkward way, the Real is more Symbolic than the Symbolic itself, since it is the culmination of the inconsistent logic of the Symbolic.\n\nThe important point is that the Symbolic is not incomplete, and the Real does not reflect this incompleteness. The efficiency of the Symbolic actually exceeds its own comprehension. It generates infinite complexities that it cannot fully account for, and it is here that the Real emerges. The Real is thus a symptom of the hyper-completeness of an unstable Symbolic structure—it testifies that there is much more to be said about the Symbolic than about whatever preceded it, and much more to know about the Symbolic than the Symbolic can know of itself."

But this misses the retroactive effect of the concept on its own ground. Indeterminacy is not a prerequisite for determinacy, but a function of it—it is the indeterminate core of any determined being that allows it to be framed as its own opposite. This is why Hegel insists that his Doctrine of Being can begin either with Being or with Nothing: the negation of being is a feature of being itself. Being presupposes what it cannot account for; it exists only by incorporating the discrepancy that remains irreducible to itself. From another perspective, nothing negates itself to produce a being other than itself, continually presupposing nothing as the mode in which existence is expressed. It is not incompleteness, but conceptual indeterminacy, that drives Hegel’s Logic toward the Concept. What escapes the Concept is not its incompleteness, but the indeterminate excess for which the Concept itself is responsible."

Unlike Schelling, who uses God as an impersonal embodiment of rationality in Naturphilosophie, Žižek’s use of God to explain ‘ontological incompleteness’ is brief: God is a lazy programmer who could not be bothered to create an absolutely complete reality, and the ‘holes’ in reality are now being revealed by quantum physics.\n\nBut if what remains is not incompleteness but an unnameable, hyper-complete indeterminacy, then God is not so much lazy as reckless. Recklessness, after all, requires more energy than laziness, and the world’s superordinate discrepancies can only be explained by an irresponsible overinvestment rather than a lazy underinvestment.\n\nThis unregulated excess of activity defines Schelling’s God, and it is this feature that Žižek’s lazy God misses. Schelling’s God constitutes Himself through an auto-generative capacity to negate His own infinite negative contraction into nothingness. God posits Himself as the very origin from which He emerges as a systematic feature of reality. As Schelling’s Die Weltalter argues, God posits Himself as preceding His own existence, as the possibility of His own past. God is thus forced to insert a disparity, a retroactive void, between Himself and His own emergence. This is where the idea of the extra-divine in the divine itself comes from. What is most central to God is precisely what cannot be subsumed by God. Schelling’s rational God is therefore in excess of Himself: not incomplete, but more God than God. Žižek’s reading of God as lazy is therefore misguided.\n\nGod is not simply a lazy programmer—He is an irresponsible automaton. If God is anything, He is like a late capitalist managerial figure who confidently represents an economic process that He cannot himself understand or account for. The reality furnished by God produces an endless series of antagonisms—He is the signpost of a system (like decentralized post-Fordist capitalism) so automated that it cannot keep up with its own consequences. God’s political economy is not incomplete, but hyper-complete: its totality extends beyond itself into a purely virtual discrepancy. Žižek’s suggestion that reality is incomplete—and the theological, Hegelian, Lacanian, and physical correlates of this idea—misses what is most evident about these systems."

      "thinking": "As a bias detection expert, my analysis focuses on identifying cognitive, social, cultural, and methodological biases in the text. This essay is a philosophical critique of Žižek's interpretation of Hegel, Lacan, and quantum physics, arguing that Žižek misreads these systems as ontologically incomplete rather than 'hyper-complete.' The author draws on a range of philosophical figures (Deleuze, Guattari, Jung, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Schelling) to support his argument, and uses complex theoretical language.\n\nKey aspects to consider:\n- The text is polemical, positioning itself against Žižek and his school. This adversarial stance may introduce confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, or selection bias in the presentation of evidence and counter-arguments.\n- The author frequently appeals to authority (e.g., Susskind, Schelling, Deleuze, Guattari) and uses dense jargon, which can obscure underlying assumptions or logical leaps.\n- There is a risk of straw-manning Žižek's position, as the author summarizes and critiques Žižek's views without extensive direct quotation or engagement with Žižek's own words.\n- The essay's framing (\"Žižek is Wrong (Again)\") signals a strong prior against Žižek, which may color the analysis and lead to confirmation bias or the false consensus effect.\n- The text's complexity and abstraction may lead to scope insensitivity, as it discusses broad metaphysical claims without always clarifying their empirical or practical implications.\n- The use of analogies (e.g., God as a bureaucrat) may introduce narrative fallacy or illusory correlation, shaping the reader's perception through storytelling rather than argument.\n\nI will focus on these potential biases, their impact, and possible mitigation strategies.",
      "summary": "This essay exhibits several notable biases from a bias detection perspective. The most significant are confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, as the author frames Žižek as repeatedly 'wrong' and constructs a critique that may not fully engage with Žižek's actual arguments. There is also evidence of selection bias in the choice of supporting philosophers, authority bias in the reliance on prestigious figures, and narrative fallacy in the use of analogies. The text's high level of abstraction introduces scope insensitivity, making it challenging to evaluate the practical significance of its claims. To mitigate these biases, the author could engage more directly with Žižek's texts, present counter-arguments more fairly, and clarify the empirical or practical stakes of the metaphysical debate.",

            "quotedText": "In 1991, Deleuze and Guattari saw an ally in physics when confronted with the question: What is Philosophy? Their use of physics was to extract models of chaos, of continuously varying virtual objects, and of an infinite multiplicity of abstracted intensities, which might point philosophy in a new direction. For Deleuze and Guattari, natural science provided possible horizons—new models of thought—which philosophy could appropriate and develop. This is radically different from what the development of quantum physics implies for the history (not the future) of philosophy. The problem of reinterpreting the history of philosophy according to contemporary epistemes is, if anything, where Slavoj Žižek sees his role: it is not about what physics means for philosophy, but about what philosophy means for physics. Unfortunately, Žižek’s method of reading modern science into philosophy—specifically into Hegel and occasionally into Lacan—goes astray almost immediately.\n\nSince the publication of the Phenomenology of Spirit, it seemed Hegel at once needed rescuing. No sooner was the foundation of dialectical idealism laid than Hegel began being misinterpreted as some mystical obscurantist or simple evolutionary philosopher of endless antitheses and syntheses. Several figures, including Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Alexandre Kojève, and the anti-Hegelian avatars of French Theory, contributed to a perpetual misreading of the rigorous processes of Hegel’s Phenomenology and Logic. With Badiou, Žižek, Jameson, and the Ljubljana School more generally, however, Hegel was re-situated as an anti-teleological thinker of ontological paradoxes par excellence.\n\nOf all three, Žižek’s reading of Hegel—the same reading which allows him to recognize Hegel’s greatest accomplices as Lacan and quantum mechanics—is the most straightforward: reality is ontologically incomplete. Yet it is exactly this conclusion which seems to betray Hegel, Lacan, and quantum physics. These ontological systems are not incomplete; they are what I would call hyper-complete: they are structured by conceptual systems that are in a perpetual overestimation, or non-identity, with themselves, and from this they produce indeterminate excesses that are entirely superordinate to the very planes on which they operate. In other words, if Hegel and quantum physics stand for anything, it is not incompleteness, but (as I will argue) the complex position of an indeterminacy that presupposes a determined, yet self-contradictory, totality.\n\nHyper-completeness, not Incompleteness\n\nAs I mentioned in Part 1 of my disagreements with Žižek, in Less Than Nothing—an otherwise impressive and monumental piece of theory—Žižek’s uniting theme across Hegel, Lacan, and quantum mechanics is that epistemological insufficiency is in fact ontological incompleteness. In other words, our inability to effectively and totally know an objective reality—no matter what experimental apparatus we use—reveals an incompleteness located in reality itself. But is a systematic, ontological ‘incompleteness’ really the red thread from Hegel to quantum physics? This conclusion seems to not only depart from all three, but to miss the more interesting conclusion: that Hegel, Lacan, and quantum mechanics furnish a far more perplexing hyper-completeness of reality. Their totalizing, logical functions contradict themselves and furnish qualitatively irreducible contradictions. This abruptness to Žižek’s positions is also what forces him to prematurely dismiss figures such as Jung, Heidegger, or Nietzsche, whom I would generally defend alongside Lacan and Hegel.\n\nFor Jung (as I am arguing in an upcoming essay for Psychoanalytic Dialogues), the collective unconscious and its archetypes are superordinate abstractions derived by the contingent, everyday structure of consciousness. The mythological archetypes are the ‘exceptions’ produced by the finite imperfections of consciousness that consciousness itself is unable to account for. The archetypal position is not what is left incomplete in human consciousness, but what is all too human, and even hyper-human, in human consciousness. For Nietzsche, similarly, the all-too-human is not a subordinate incompleteness, but a topographically higher mode of human drive. The will to power, for example, is a dizzying departure from nature, rather than a remnant of humanity’s natural ground. It expresses a human impulse that humanity itself fails to coherently assimilate. Madness is, for Nietzsche, therefore more rational than sanity itself.\n\nWe see a similar avowal with Lacan, where the same superordinate position can be ascribed to the Real. The Real is not a simple remainder of the process of symbolization, an abnormal x that forever fails to find its place in the Symbolic (which is how Žižek describes it in The Sublime Object of Ideology). This view of the Real implies that the Symbolic is a consistent totality—yet if Lacan insists on anything, it is that the Symbolic, or language, is irreconcilable with itself. It produces enigmas and contradictions that are only possible because language is already there, and inevitably fails to account for its own consequences. Hence why language indefinitely displaces its own implications in the register of the (always absent) big Other.\n\nThe Real is for Lacan a distortion of the Symbolic that is produced by the Symbolic itself. Much like rules can’t be broken if the game itself is thrown away, if the Symbolic is taken away, so is the Real. To put it in a slightly awkward way, the Real is more Symbolic than the Symbolic itself, since it is the culmination of the inconsistent logic of the Symbolic.\n\nThe important point is that the Symbolic is not incomplete, and the Real does not reflect this incompleteness. The efficiency of the Symbolic actually exceeds its own comprehension. It generates infinite complexities that it cannot fully account for, and it is here that the Real emerges. The Real is thus a symptom of the hyper-completeness of an unstable Symbolic structure—it testifies that there is much more to be said about the Symbolic than about whatever preceded it, and much more to know about the Symbolic than the Symbolic can know of itself.\n\nWith Hegel—whom Žižek relies on even more than Lacan—the notion of ‘incompleteness’ is equally inadequate. The interpretation of Hegel as anti-teleological is correct: Hegel does not claim that Spirit is moving toward a final point where everything is known and predicted. Instead, absolute knowledge is an acknowledgment of radical openness and infinite formal possibilities, constructed by a conceptual knowledge that presupposes only itself. What stands out in Hegel’s system is not incompleteness that leaves determinacy open, but the indeterminacy that arises from determinacy itself.\n\nA straightforward view of Hegel’s Science of Logic traces a path from indeterminacy, to determinate being or existence, to essence, and finally to the concept. But this misses the retroactive effect of the concept on its own ground. Indeterminacy is not a prerequisite for determinacy, but a function of it—it is the indeterminate core of any determined being that allows it to be framed as its own opposite. This is why Hegel insists that his Doctrine of Being can begin either with Being or with Nothing: the negation of being is a feature of being itself. Being presupposes what it cannot account for; it exists only by incorporating the discrepancy that remains irreducible to itself. From another perspective, nothing negates itself to produce a being other than itself, continually presupposing nothing as the mode in which existence is expressed. It is not incompleteness, but conceptual indeterminacy, that drives Hegel’s Logic toward the Concept. What escapes the Concept is not its incompleteness, but the indeterminate excess for which the Concept itself is responsible.\n\nThe famous Hegelian idea that substance appears as subject, and in doing so reconstructs substance as presupposing its own (subjective) disparity toward itself, does not mean—as Žižek seems to imply—that substance or ontological reality is merely incomplete. Rather, it means that it has an indeterminate affinity to what it cannot account for: the subjective position inscribed within the a-subjective. The shift from incompleteness to indeterminacy is also relevant in quantum physics. Insisting on an a priori incompleteness in the subatomic structure of the world misses what Leonard Susskind describes as a production of indeterminacy in quantum states. Whether we argue that consciousness is incalculable, or that observation internally determines the observed, the crux of quantum entanglement is indeterminacy. For example, aligning a measurement apparatus with possible values of a quantum property like spin will influence the values observed. There is something there to be measured, but for it to be there, it must produce an indeterminacy regarding its own probabilities.\n\nEmphasizing indeterminacy over incompleteness may seem minor, but it is a crucial distinction.

This can create illusory correlations between abstract metaphysical concepts and familiar social roles, potentially oversimplifying complex ideas.",

            "quotedText": "God as a Middle-Management Bureaucrat\n\nIn the spirit of Schelling, Žižek reformulates God to elaborate his ontological position. Unlike Schelling, who uses God as an impersonal embodiment of rationality in Naturphilosophie, Žižek’s use of God to explain ‘ontological incompleteness’ is brief: God is a lazy programmer who could not be bothered to create an absolutely complete reality, and the ‘holes’ in reality are now being revealed by quantum physics.\n\nBut if what remains is not incompleteness but an unnameable, hyper-complete indeterminacy, then God is not so much lazy as reckless. Recklessness, after all, requires more energy than laziness, and the world’s superordinate discrepancies can only be explained by an irresponsible overinvestment rather than a lazy underinvestment.\n\nThis unregulated excess of activity defines Schelling’s God, and it is this feature that Žižek’s lazy God misses. Schelling’s God constitutes Himself through an auto-generative capacity to negate His own infinite negative contraction into nothingness. God posits Himself as the very origin from which He emerges as a systematic feature of reality. As Schelling’s Die Weltalter argues, God posits Himself as preceding His own existence, as the possibility of His own past. God is thus forced to insert a disparity, a retroactive void, between Himself and His own emergence. This is where the idea of the extra-divine in the divine itself comes from. What is most central to God is precisely what cannot be subsumed by God. Schelling’s rational God is therefore in excess of Himself: not incomplete, but more God than God. Žižek’s reading of God as lazy is therefore misguided.\n\nGod is not simply a lazy programmer—He is an irresponsible automaton. If God is anything, He is like a late capitalist managerial figure who confidently represents an economic process that He cannot himself understand or account for. The reality furnished by God produces an endless series of antagonisms—He is the signpost of a system (like decentralized post-Fordist capitalism) so automated that it cannot keep up with its own consequences. God’s political economy is not incomplete, but hyper-complete: its totality extends beyond itself into a purely virtual discrepancy."
