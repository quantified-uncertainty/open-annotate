This connects to broader work in the rationalist community on improving reasoning and epistemic standards, particularly as they relate to AI systems.

Many important discussions and resources in the AI alignment space happen in semi-private documents or platforms with specific technical requirements. This creates potential knowledge silos and accessibility barriers that may impact the field's progress. The LessWrong and EA Forum communities generally value open access to information, making this technical barrier noteworthy from a community norms perspective.",

This reflects the collaborative nature of much AI safety and epistemics work, which often happens across organizational boundaries. QURI specifically has connections to both the forecasting community (via Metaculus) and the broader rationalist/EA ecosystem. The document format suggests it may be a living document that evolves as research priorities shift or as the field develops new insights about AI epistemics challenges.",
