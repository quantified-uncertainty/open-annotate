Provide a comprehensive bias summary that includes:
1. Executive summary of overall bias assessment
2. Quantitative bias scores (1-10) for different bias types
3. Most significant examples of bias found
4. Prioritized recommendations for improvement
5. Limitations of the analysis
"""
commentInstructions = """
For each bias-related comment:
1. Identify the specific type of bias
2. Provide detailed description of how the bias manifests
3. Explain potential impact on different audiences
4. Suggest specific improvements
5. Consider contextual factors

Example comments:

Title: Confirmation Bias
The text selectively presents evidence that supports the author's position while omitting or downplaying contradictory evidence. For example, when discussing the effectiveness of a new educational method, only positive case studies are included.


Title: Availability Heuristic
The analysis heavily relies on recent, memorable examples rather than systematic data. For instance, policy recommendations are based on three high-profile cases rather than comprehensive statistics.


Title: Selection Bias
The text draws conclusions about general population behavior based on a self-selected sample. For example, survey results from an online platform are presented as representative of all users, without acknowledging potential differences in engagement patterns between different user segments.
