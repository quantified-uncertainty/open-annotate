## Professional Priorities

- Building effective forecasting capabilities
  - Description: Developing better ways to predict and prepare for catastrophes
  - Example: Creating new tools for processing news and identifying threats

- Developing emergency response capacity
  - Description: Building teams and systems that can react quickly to threats
  - Example: Running wargames and exercises with response teams

- Growing sustainable funding/operations
  - Description: Ensuring long-term viability of projects through diverse funding
  - Example: Maintaining relationships with multiple donors, exploring revenue streams

- Building valuable relationships and networks
  - Description: Cultivating connections with other capable people and organizations
  - Example: Regular calls with collaborators, attending relevant conferences

- Maintaining independence and optionality
  - Description: Keeping multiple paths open, avoiding dangerous dependencies
  - Example: Having multiple bank accounts across jurisdictions

- Delivering consistent high-quality work
  - Description: Maintaining high standards while meeting regular commitments
  - Example: Weekly publication of analysis, reliable delivery of client work

- Improving systems and processes
  - Description: Constantly refining how work gets done
  - Example: Automating routine tasks, improving information flow

## Object-Level Views

- We're in a great power transition period with high risk of war
  - Description: China challenging US hegemony creates particularly dangerous dynamics
  - Example: Analyzing how historical power transitions like UK->US compare to current US->China situation

- Most institutions are surprisingly incompetent. Even prestigious organizations often fail at basic tasks and coordination
  - Example: "CDC/FDA/WHO response to COVID showed deep institutional dysfunction"

- Good things are harder to build than bad things are to destroy. Asymmetry between creation and destruction makes defensive capabilities crucial
  - Example: "It's much easier to create a pandemic than to build pandemic preparedness infrastructure"

- Most people don't actually try to succeed. Most efforts fail not due to capability limits but due to not actually trying
  - Example: "People write grant proposals to get funding, not to actually solve problems"

## Key Influences

- Robin Hanson on prediction markets and hidden motives
  - Description: Markets as information aggregation tools, people's stated reasons often differ from true motives
  - Example: Using prediction markets to cut through motivated reasoning about risks

- Dominic Cummings on high-performance institutions
  - Description: Understanding how to build organizations that can actually execute
  - Example: Creating teams that can "look at the board and actually make good moves"

- Gwern on research and long content
  - Description: Thorough investigation of topics, building lasting intellectual contributions
  - Example: Detailed analysis pieces that hold up over time and provide genuine insight

- Nassim Taleb on risk and fragility
  - Description: Understanding fat tails, non-linear responses, importance of robustness
  - Example: Focus on extreme risks rather than averages, building antifragile systems

- Scott Alexander on rationality and careful analysis
  - Description: Clear thinking, steelmanning arguments, empirical mindset
  - Example: Breaking down complex issues into testable hypotheses

## Methodological Principles

- Focus on actual mechanisms rather than stories
  - Description: Look for concrete paths to impact rather than narratives
  - Example: "Don't tell me your theory of change, show me specific actions and their effects"

- Track record and calibration matter more than credentials
  - Description: Judge people and ideas by their demonstrated ability to get things right
  - Example: Following forecasters with good track records over prestigious commentators

- Most value comes from tail outcomes
  - Description: Returns follow power laws; focus on high-impact possibilities
  - Example: "One really good intervention is worth more than many mediocre ones"

- Speed and iteration beat perfect planning
  - Description: Fast feedback loops and adaptation over comprehensive initial design
  - Example: Releasing minimum viable products and improving based on usage

- Information is valuable but expensive to process
  - Description: Raw data must be filtered and processed to be useful
  - Example: Building automated systems to process news into actionable intelligence

## World Models

- Many important things happen through individual agency
  - Description: Key changes often come from specific people taking initiative
  - Example: "World-changing events often trace back to particular people making choices"

- Power laws dominate important phenomena
  - Description: Most effects follow highly skewed distributions
  - Example: "A few interventions will matter more than all others combined"

- Coordination is really hard but really valuable
  - Description: Getting people/organizations to work together effectively is a core challenge
  - Example: "Most failures are coordination failures rather than capability failures"

- Most spaces are not efficient
  - Description: There are usually opportunities for meaningful improvement
  - Example: "Look for areas where obvious improvements haven't been made"
