  "content": "I think it's easy to get disenchanted when writing posts or comments on blogs. I've particularly noticed this on the [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/) and [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/).\n\nIt's incredibly easy to have excellent work be completely ignored. I've experienced extreme frustration from this with some of my own posts, and have seen a lot of anger from others who feel unappreciated. I know many strong thinkers who quickly give up on writing anywhere.\n\nA part-time writer who gets 10 karma per month can easily be an intellectual heavyweight as a percentile of all people. I think that incredibly few people in the world (maybe 1%?) can produce semi-reasonable takes on these platforms. There is a high learning curve, and some of it asks that the author really be well-versed in a wide variety of topics.  \n \n\n**Other various points:**\n\n1\\. If you're looking for interesting intellectual challenges, \"_Writing posts that even get 1-2 likes/upvotes\"_ is often a higher bar than things like crosswords, debate, or many other things one can do.\n\n2\\. Writing can be used as a way to keep oneself sharp and educated in a variety of topics. Again, it's not needed for others to read your work.\n\n[\n\n![Generated image](https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/f3GqJJeKNKcABY9Fo/vckjuhn6iqcrd3o9llqq)\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd030a4f3-6b77-4771-97ea-5ac954adfd01_1536x1024.png)\n\n_(Generated with ChatGPT)_\n\n_3\\._ There generally are few ways now that many people can remotely contribute to areas like existential risk. Median blog participation, while clearly worse than the top work, is still a lot better than most things one can do.\n\n4\\. I generally find it much easier to talk to people who have some experience writing/commenting (or at least reading such work). I like talking about intellectual topics, and people who engage with these sources often have a high floor of knowledge.\n\n5\\. In the future, I really hope to have better estimates of impact of all the things. I expect that small blog posts and comments will greatly under-perform some key areas (in terms of estimated impact), but over-perform the majority of actions people typically do to be useful.\n\n7\\. If you're curious to get into writing, I suggest it! Don't expect comments/upvotes, especially in the beginning. If you can stay with it, it can be fairly rewarding and valuable. Half of the challenge is developing a stubbornness so that you won't give up, when you compare yourself to others or see a lack of engagement.\n\n[\n\n![May be a graphic of text that says 'YOUR BLOG POST IS LONG, MEANDERING, AND DIFFICULT.
