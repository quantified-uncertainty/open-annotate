```python
# Sample usage of our new ML platform API
import quantum_analytics as qa

# Initialize connection
client = qa.Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Create predictive model
model = client.create_model(
    name="Sales Forecast Model",
    data_source="sales_data_warehouse",
    target_variable="monthly_revenue",
    features=["customer_segment", "product_category", "seasonality"]
)

# Train model with historical data
training_result = model.train(
    start_date="2022-01-01",
    end_date="2024-09-30",
    validation_split=0.2
)

print(f"Model accuracy: {training_result.accuracy:.2%}")
print(f"Training completed in: {training_result.duration_seconds}s")

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(
    forecast_period="2024-Q4",
    confidence_interval=0.95
)
```

### Market Expansion

We expanded operations into three new geographic markets: Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia. These regions represent significant growth opportunities with combined addressable markets exceeding $180 billion. Local partnerships and regulatory compliance preparations are progressing according to plan.
