# Data Privacy and Security Policy

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This Data Privacy and Security Policy establishes comprehensive guidelines for the collection, processing, storage, and protection of personal and sensitive information within our organization. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners, and third-party service providers who handle data on behalf of the company.

The policy ensures compliance with applicable data protection regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other relevant privacy laws. It outlines our commitment to protecting individual privacy rights while enabling legitimate business operations.

All data processing activities must align with the principles of data minimization, purpose limitation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability as defined in this policy.

## 2. Data Classification and Handling Requirements

### 2.1 Personal Data Categories

Personal data is classified into the following categories based on sensitivity and risk:

**Category A - Highly Sensitive Data:** Includes financial information, health records, biometric data, social security numbers, and authentication credentials. This data requires the highest level of protection with encryption at rest and in transit, restricted access controls, and mandatory audit logging.

**Category B - Sensitive Personal Data:** Encompasses names, email addresses, phone numbers, demographic information, and usage analytics. Standard encryption and access controls apply, with regular access reviews and data retention policies enforced.

**Category C - Public or Low-Risk Data:** Covers publicly available information and aggregated, anonymized datasets. Basic security measures apply, though data integrity and availability remain important considerations.

### 2.2 Data Processing Principles

All data processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent. Personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes. Data subjects must be informed about processing activities through clear privacy notices.

Data accuracy is maintained through regular validation procedures and prompt correction of inaccuracies. Personal data is kept only for as long as necessary to fulfill the stated purposes, with automatic deletion processes implemented where feasible.

## 3. Technical Security Measures

### 3.1 Encryption Standards

All personal data must be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms:
- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3 or higher
- Database encryption: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Backup encryption: AES-256 with secure key management

### 3.2 Access Controls and Authentication

Multi-factor authentication is mandatory for all systems processing personal data. Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users receive minimum necessary permissions. Access rights are reviewed quarterly and immediately revoked upon employment termination.

System administrators require additional approval for privileged access, and all administrative activities are logged and monitored. Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments ensure security controls remain effective.

## 4. Data Subject Rights and Procedures

### 4.1 Individual Rights

Data subjects have the right to:
- Be informed about data processing activities
- Access their personal data
- Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data
- Request erasure of personal data
- Restrict processing under certain circumstances
- Data portability in machine-readable formats
- Object to processing based on legitimate interests

### 4.2 Response Procedures

All data subject requests must be acknowledged within 72 hours and resolved within 30 days unless an extension is justified. Free identity verification is required before processing requests. Complex requests may require additional time with appropriate communication to the data subject.

A centralized request tracking system maintains records of all data subject requests, responses, and any appeals or complaints received.

## 5. Breach Response and Incident Management

Data breaches involving personal data must be reported to the Data Protection Officer within 24 hours of discovery. Risk assessment determines notification requirements to supervisory authorities and affected individuals based on likelihood and severity of impact to rights and freedoms.

Incident response procedures include immediate containment, forensic investigation, impact assessment, and implementation of corrective measures to prevent recurrence. Post-incident reviews identify lessons learned and policy improvements.
