# Agentic Document Analysis Experiment

**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Status**: Experiment - Too expensive for production

## Summary
Attempted to create a truly agentic document analysis system using Claude's tool calling.

## Results
- ✅ Successfully implemented autonomous agent with 7 tools
- ✅ Agent makes intelligent decisions about what to analyze
- ❌ Extremely expensive: $0.175 for minimal output
- ❌ Sends entire document on every tool call

## Key Learning
The approach is conceptually sound but economically unfeasible due to:
- Full document context on every turn (25k chars × 4 turns)
- Expensive model (Sonnet) for all decisions
- Chatty tool design requiring many turns

## Files
- `agenticAnalysis/index.ts` - Main implementation
- `test-agentic-analysis.ts` - Test script
- `/tmp/agentic-analysis-output.json` - Sample output

## Cost Analysis
- 2,287 chars output for $0.175 = $76/million chars
- Compare to old system: ~$20/million chars
