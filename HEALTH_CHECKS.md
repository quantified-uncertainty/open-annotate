### Manual Review Process
1. Pick a section from above
2. Go through each checklist item
3. Document findings in a separate file
4. Create issues for items needing fixes

3. **Direct database queries instead of using Prisma**
4. **Hardcoded values that should be configurable**
5. **Missing error boundaries around async operations**
6. **Components over 300 lines**
7. **Files with multiple responsibilities**
8. **Commented out code blocks**
9. **TODO comments older than 3 months**
10. **Test files with `.skip` or low coverage**
