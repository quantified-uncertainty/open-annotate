## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Keep it current** - Update docs when making related code changes
2. **Be specific** - Include exact file paths and line numbers for issues
3. **Provide examples** - Code snippets and commands help understanding
4. **Cross-reference** - Link to related documentation sections
5. **Test procedures** - Verify documented procedures actually work

## Migration Notes

This documentation structure consolidates several previously scattered files:
- `AGENTS.md` ‚Üí `development/agents.md` (updated with current database approach)
- `COMPREHENSIVE_HEALTH_CHECKS.md` + `HEALTH_CHECKS.md` ‚Üí `operations/health-checks.md`
- `PRE_COMMIT_INVESTIGATION.md` ‚Üí `security/pre-commit.md`
- `TODO-CRITICAL-ISSUES.md` ‚Üí *removed (all items completed)*

The main `CLAUDE.md` file remains at the project root as it contains critical development notes specific to Claude Code operations.
