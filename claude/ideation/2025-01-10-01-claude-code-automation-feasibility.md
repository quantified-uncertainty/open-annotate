# Claude Code Automation Feasibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

After thorough investigation, Claude Code CLI/SDK automation for RoastMyPost document evaluations is **technically possible but economically infeasible**. While the tool can perform the required tasks, costs are prohibitively high - approximately 3.8x more expensive than current approaches.

## Key Findings

### 1. Cost Analysis (from PR #58)
- **Agentic approach**: $76 per million characters
- **Current scripted approach**: $20 per million characters
- **Single minimal analysis**: $0.175
- **Root cause**: Claude Code SDK sends "entire document on every tool call"

### 2. Tool Permission Limitations
In headless mode (`claude -p`), several tools require manual approval:
- WebSearch - Requires user confirmation
- Bash - Requires permission
- Edit/Write - File modifications need approval
- WebFetch - Web access requires confirmation

Workarounds exist:
- `--allowedTools` to pre-approve specific tools
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (security risk)
- Limit to read-only operations

### 3. Community Experience
From Hacker News and Reddit discussions:
- "Claude Code is amazing. Unfortunately, it's also very expensive"
- Can "set my credit card on fire" with uncapped usage
- Every session pre-loads ~10,500 tokens in system prompts
- Simple tasks consume 50,000+ tokens easily
- Users created monitoring tools (ccusage, Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor)

### 4. Fundamental Design Mismatch
Claude Code is "task-oriented" - designed for discrete coding tasks, not continuous document processing. The agentic nature means it:
- Pulls entire context repeatedly
- Has no optimization for large text workflows
- Wasn't designed for document analysis use cases

## Monitoring and Logging Options

### Available Metrics
1. **OpenTelemetry Integration**
   ```bash
   CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1 \
   OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=console \
   OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=console \
   claude -p "Evaluate blog post" --max-turns 15
   ```
   
   Tracks:
   - `claude_code.cost.usage` - Cost in USD
   - `claude_code.token.usage` - Tokens by type
   - `claude_code.api.request.duration` - Performance
   - `claude_code.lines_of_code.modified` - Code changes

2. **Console Output Logging**
   ```bash
   claude -p "Task" 2>&1 | tee evaluation_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
   ```

3. **JSON Output**
   ```bash
   claude -p "Task" --output-format json > result.json
   ```

### Cost Tracking
- Average: $6/developer/day
- 90% of users stay under $12/day
- No built-in persistent logging
- Must use external monitoring for long-term tracking

## Why This Matters for RoastMyPost

The PR #58 experiment proved that while Claude Code can technically evaluate documents:
1. It's 3.8x more expensive than alternatives
2. The tool architecture doesn't suit document analysis
3. Every evaluation would be unsustainably expensive

## Alternative Approaches Investigated

### 1. LangGraph (LangChain)
**Pros:**
- Sophisticated context management with "write, select, compress, isolate" strategies
- Thread-scoped and long-term memory persistence
- Multi-agent support with hierarchical architectures
- Production-ready with major companies using it
- Built-in state management and observability

**Cons:**
- Still relatively new (2024) with potential breaking changes
- May still have similar token usage issues for document analysis

### 2. DSPy (Stanford)
**Pros:**
- Automatic prompt optimization reduces manual engineering
- Programmatic approach could minimize token usage
- "Teleprompters" optimize prompts based on training data

**Cons:**
- Less mature ecosystem than LangChain
- Better for specific task optimization than general document processing

### 3. Anthropic Prompt Caching (Native Solution)
**Pros:**
- **90% cost reduction** for cached content
- **85% latency reduction** for long prompts
- Perfect for document analysis - cache entire documents
- No third-party dependencies
- 200k token context windows
- Cache duration: 5 minutes (refreshed with use)

**Cons:**
- Requires careful cache management
- Initial cache write is more expensive
- 1024 token minimum for caching

## Recommended Solution: Anthropic Prompt Caching

For RoastMyPost's document evaluation use case, **Anthropic's native prompt caching** appears to be the optimal solution:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: 90% reduction brings costs from $76/million chars down to ~$7.60/million chars
2. **Document-Focused**: Explicitly designed for "talk to books, papers, documentation"
3. **Simple Implementation**: No complex agent frameworks needed
4. **Proven Technology**: Generally available, not experimental

### Implementation Strategy
```python
# Cache the document content
cache_control = {"type": "ephemeral"}
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": document_content, "cache_control": cache_control},
            {"type": "text", "text": evaluation_prompt}
        ]
    }
]

# Multiple evaluations hit the cache
response = anthropic.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    messages=messages,
    headers={"anthropic-beta": "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"}
)
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement prompt caching in the existing RoastMyPost evaluation pipeline
2. Measure actual cost savings vs current approach
3. Consider hybrid approach: cache documents + use agents for specific tasks
4. Monitor cache hit rates and optimize cache breakpoints
