# Assessment: Extracting Evaluation Code into NPM Library

## Executive Summary

Extracting the evaluation code into an independent NPM library is **highly valuable** and **moderately complex** to implement. The effort would take approximately **2-3 weeks** for a complete implementation, but could be done incrementally. The main challenge lies in properly abstracting database dependencies and managing the agent type system migration.

## Value Assessment (Score: 9/10)

### High Value Benefits:
1. **Reusability**: Enable external projects to use the evaluation system
2. **Modularity**: Better separation of concerns between UI and evaluation logic
3. **Testing**: Easier to test evaluation logic in isolation
4. **Version Control**: NPM versioning allows controlled updates
5. **Community**: Opens possibility for external contributions
6. **CLI Tool**: Enables command-line evaluation workflows

### Impact on Current Application:
- Minimal disruption if done correctly
- Improved code organization
- Clearer dependency management

## Implementation Complexity (Effort: Medium-High)

### Phase 1: Monorepo Setup (3-5 days)
- Convert to npm workspaces structure
- Reorganize code into apps/ and packages/ directories
- Set up shared dependencies
- Maintain development workflow

### Phase 2: Core Extraction (5-7 days)
- Extract evaluation logic from `/src/lib/documentAnalysis/`
- Create storage adapter pattern for database abstraction
- Design clean public API
- Handle configuration and API keys
- Implement logging abstraction

### Phase 3: Type System Migration (3-4 days)
The "tricky" agent schema migration involves:
- Resolving dual naming (agentType vs purpose)
- Creating portable type definitions
- Ensuring backward compatibility
- Handling Prisma-generated vs Zod types

### Phase 4: CLI Development (2-3 days)
- Build command-line interface
- Support TOML/JSON agent configs
- Add file input/output options
- Create documentation

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (2-3 days)
- Comprehensive test suite
- API documentation
- Migration guide
- Example projects

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. **Monorepo Tool**
**Recommendation**: Start with npm workspaces, migrate to Turborepo if needed
- Simple to implement
- No new tooling to learn
- Can upgrade later

### 2. **Database Abstraction**
**Recommendation**: Storage adapter pattern
```typescript
interface StorageAdapter {
  saveEvaluation(evaluation: Evaluation): Promise<void>
  getAgent(id: string): Promise<Agent>
}
```
- Allows in-memory, file, or database storage
- Maintains flexibility
- Easy testing

### 3. **API Design**
**Recommendation**: Simple, progressive API
```typescript
// Basic usage
const evaluator = new Evaluator()
const result = await evaluator.evaluate(document, agent)

// Advanced usage
const evaluator = new Evaluator({
  apiKeys: { anthropic: 'key' },
  storage: new PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  onProgress: (p) => console.log(p)
})
```

### 4. **Type Management**
**Recommendation**: Shared types package
- Single source of truth for types
- Both runtime (Zod) and compile-time (TypeScript) validation
- Version types separately from implementation

### 5. **Configuration Format**
**Recommendation**: Support multiple formats
- TOML for human-friendly configs
- JSON for programmatic use
- TypeScript for type safety

## Risk Mitigation

### Major Risks:
1. **Breaking existing functionality**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite before refactoring
   - Use feature flags for gradual migration

2. **Type system complexity**
   - Mitigation: Create migration scripts
   - Document type mappings clearly

3. **Performance regression**
   - Mitigation: Benchmark before/after
   - Maintain existing optimizations

4. **API design lock-in**
   - Mitigation: Start with minimal API
   - Use semantic versioning properly

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1:
- Set up monorepo structure
- Extract core evaluation logic
- Create basic storage adapters
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Week 2:
- Build CLI tool
- Implement streaming/progress
- Add comprehensive tests
- Create migration scripts

### Week 3:
- Write documentation
- Create example projects
- Performance optimization
- Beta testing with internal use

### Future Enhancements:
- Plugin system for custom workflows
- Web UI for evaluation management
- Cloud-hosted evaluation service
- Integration with popular frameworks

## Recommendation

**Proceed with the extraction** using an incremental approach:

1. Start with monorepo conversion (low risk, high benefit)
2. Extract core logic with minimal API
3. Build CLI as proof of concept
4. Iterate based on usage feedback
5. Publish to NPM when stable

The investment is worthwhile given the potential for reuse, better testing, and community engagement. The modular architecture will also make the main application easier to maintain and evolve.
