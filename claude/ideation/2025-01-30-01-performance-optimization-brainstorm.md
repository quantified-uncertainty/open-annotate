# Performance Optimization Brainstorming Guide for RoastMyPost

## Problem Statement
Document pages are loading slowly (2.1MB+ of data), causing poor user experience when navigating between pages. The root cause is overfetching data with deeply nested queries that load all evaluations, comments, highlights, and related data at once.

## Quick Recommendation
Given the 2.1MB payload issue, start with:
1. **Query Optimization** (2-3 days) - Can reduce payload by 60-80%
2. **Database Indexing** (4 hours) - Quick win for query speed
3. **Progressive Loading** (1 week) - Improve perceived performance

These three projects alone could solve most of your performance issues without adding significant complexity.

## Current Architecture Pain Points

### 1. Data Overfetching
- **Problem**: `DocumentModel.getDocumentWithEvaluations` loads entire object graph
- **Impact**: 2.1MB+ payload for documents with many evaluations
- **Symptoms**: Slow page transitions, high memory usage, poor mobile experience

### 2. Database Query Inefficiency
- **Problem**: No indexes on commonly joined fields
- **Impact**: Full table scans for document+agent lookups
- **Symptoms**: Slow query execution, database CPU spikes

### 3. Rendering Bottlenecks
- **Problem**: Entire component tree re-renders on navigation
- **Impact**: UI freezes during data processing
- **Symptoms**: Janky scrolling, delayed interactions

## Performance Optimization Projects

### Project 1: Query Optimization
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ (Easy-Medium)  
**Time Estimate**: 2-3 days  
**Expected Impact**: 60-80% reduction in data transfer

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Instead of loading everything:
const document = await prisma.document.findUnique({
  include: {
    versions: { include: { everything } },
    evaluations: { include: { everything } },
    // ... 10 more nested includes
  }
});

// Load only what's needed:
const document = await prisma.document.findUnique({
  include: {
    versions: { take: 1, orderBy: { version: 'desc' } },
    evaluations: { select: { id: true, agentId: true } }
  }
});
```

**Main Challenges**:
- Identifying exactly what data each page needs
- Updating all TypeScript types to match new query shapes
- Testing to ensure no missing data breaks UI
- Coordinating changes across multiple components

**Long-term Downsides**:
- More complex queries to maintain (multiple specific queries vs one generic)
- Risk of N+1 problems if not careful with related data
- Need to update queries when UI requirements change

CREATE INDEX idx_version_latest ON "DocumentVersion" ("documentId", "version" DESC);
```

**Main Challenges**:
- Initial index creation may lock tables (use CONCURRENTLY)
- Need to analyze query patterns first
- Testing impact in production-like environment

**Long-term Downsides**:
- Increased storage space (5-10% per index)

const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

// Cache invalidation strategy
await redis.del(`doc:${docId}:*`); // On document update
```

**Main Challenges**:
- Cache invalidation complexity

- `/api/docs/[id]/evaluations` - Evaluation list
- `/api/docs/[id]/evaluation/[evalId]` - Single evaluation details
- `/api/docs/[id]/comments?offset=0&limit=50` - Paginated comments

**Main Challenges**:
- Coordinating multiple API calls
- Handling partial failures gracefully
- Maintaining backwards compatibility
