# DocumentAnalysis - VERIFIED Safe to Delete Files

After thorough verification, only these files are actually safe to delete:

## Truly Unused Files (4 files)

1. **`multiEpistemicEval/demo-metadata.ts`** - Demo metadata (3KB)
2. **`shared/simplePluginLocationWrappers.ts`** - Unused plugin wrappers (1.9KB)
3. **`shared/errorCategorization.ts`** - Unused error categorization (4.6KB)
4. **`shared/enhancedPluginLocationWrappers.ts`** - Unused enhanced wrappers (3.6KB)

## Total: 13.1KB (4 files)

## Files That ARE Being Used (Contrary to Initial Analysis)

- `index.ts` - Used by 60+ files across the codebase
- `utils/LocationUtils.ts` - Used by TextChunk and other plugin files
- `shared/types.ts` - Used by 100+ files
- `shared/retryUtils.ts` - Used by claude/wrapper.ts
- `linkAnalysis/prompts.ts` - Used by several files
- `highlightGeneration/types.ts` - Used by 100+ files

## Safe Deletion Commands

```bash
cd /Users/ozziegooen/Documents/Github/ui-cleanup

# Delete the 4 verified unused files
git rm src/lib/documentAnalysis/multiEpistemicEval/demo-metadata.ts
git rm src/lib/documentAnalysis/shared/simplePluginLocationWrappers.ts
git rm src/lib/documentAnalysis/shared/errorCategorization.ts
git rm src/lib/documentAnalysis/shared/enhancedPluginLocationWrappers.ts
```

## Key Findings

1. **Initial analysis was misleading** - Many files that appeared unused are actually imported through various paths
2. **Only 13.1KB of truly dead code** vs initial estimate of 31KB
3. **Most location utilities are still in use** - Refactoring to use centralized location finder would be a larger task

## Recommendations

1. **Delete the 4 verified files** - Low risk, immediate cleanup
2. **Location finding consolidation** - Should be a separate, careful refactor
3. **Highlight extraction complexity** - Still valid concern, but requires careful refactoring since it's actively used
