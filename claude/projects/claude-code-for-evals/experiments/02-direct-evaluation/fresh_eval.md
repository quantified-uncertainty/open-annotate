# Evaluation Working Document: Why the tails fall apart

## Metadata
- Document ID: eval-tails-001
- Article URL: LessWrong post (cross-posted from thepolemicalmedic.com)
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Current Phase: initial_analysis
- Iterations Completed: 0/2

## Constraints & Requirements
- Maximum 2 iterations
- Must evaluate: factual accuracy, logical consistency, writing quality
- Output format: structured analysis with highlights and comments
- Tone: constructive but thorough

## Planning & Coordination
### Completed Tasks
- [ ] Import and parse article
- [ ] Initial content analysis
- [ ] Fact checking
- [ ] Logic evaluation
- [ ] Style assessment
- [ ] Generate highlights
- [ ] Final synthesis

### Current Focus
Working on: Initial content analysis
Next up: Fact checking

### Iteration Log
1. [2025-07-10] Starting evaluation - article imported

## Working Memory
### Key Claims Identified
1. Height correlates with basketball performance but the tallest aren't the best players
2. IQ predicts various life outcomes but extreme IQ doesn't scale linearly with success
3. Correlations break down at the extremes - "tails diverge"
4. This is a general phenomenon explained by elliptical distributions
5. Multiple factors contribute to outcomes, causing divergence at extremes

### Research Notes
- Article provides specific examples: NBA height, tennis serves, IQ and income
- Uses scatter plot visualizations to demonstrate the concept
- Offers both graphical and intuitive explanations
- Includes geometric interpretation using vector angles

### Identified Issues
- Heavy reliance on intuitive explanations without rigorous mathematical proofs
- Some claims lack specific citations (e.g., IQ and imprisonment correlation)
- Toy model assumptions may oversimplify real-world complexity

## Draft Outputs
