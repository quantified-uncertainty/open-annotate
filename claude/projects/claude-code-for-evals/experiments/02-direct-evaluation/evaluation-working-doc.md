**Active Task:** [None - Starting evaluation]

## Working Memory

### Article Summary
- Main topic: Statistical phenomenon where extreme outliers in one correlated variable don't correspond to extreme outliers in another
- Key examples: Height/basketball, serve speed/tennis ranking, IQ/wealth
- Three explanations offered: graphical, intuitive, geometric

### Key Claims to Verify
1. Average NBA height is 6'7"
2. Fastest tennis servers aren't the best players
3. High IQ predicts income, imprisonment rates, lifespan
4. Bill Gates is ~+4SD in intelligence
5. R-square of 0.5 is "remarkably strong in social sciences"

### Notable Assertions
- Tail divergence is ubiquitous across correlated variables
- Multiple factors contribute to outcomes (not just single predictors)
- This has implications for EA's focus on finding "the best" interventions

### Questions/Concerns
- Some links appear to be from 2008-2014 (may be outdated)
- Mathematical rigor acknowledged as potentially lacking by author
- Several claims marked with "I'd guess" or "I'd intuit"

## Draft Outputs

### Strengths Identified
- Clear, accessible explanation of complex statistical concept
- Multiple complementary explanations (graphical, intuitive, geometric)
- Good use of real-world examples
- Honest about limitations and uncertainties
- Relevant application to EA decision-making

### Weaknesses Identified
- Some outdated references (2008-2014)
- Mathematical explanations could be more rigorous
- Several unverified statistical claims
- Images may not load properly (external hosting)
- Some notation inconsistencies (e.g., "+4SD" vs "4SD")

### Areas for Improvement
- Update references to more recent data
- Provide more precise statistical backing
- Consider adding interactive visualizations
- Clarify relationship between R-square and correlation coefficient
- Expand on practical implications beyond EA

### Final Evaluation Notes
[To be completed after full analysis]
