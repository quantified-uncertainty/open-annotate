# Evaluation: "Why the tails fall apart"

## Main Thesis
The post argues that in any correlation between two variables, extreme outliers in one variable rarely correspond to extreme outliers in the other. This "divergence of tails" phenomenon is universal: the tallest people aren't the best basketball players, the smartest aren't the richest, and the fastest servers don't win the most tennis matches. The author explains this through both graphical and intuitive models, showing that correlations form elliptical distributions rather than perfect lines, causing divergence at the extremes.

## Strength
The post's greatest strength is its multiple explanatory approaches. By presenting graphical, geometric, and intuitive explanations, the author makes a complex statistical concept accessible to different types of thinkers. The real-world examples (basketball height, tennis serves, IQ and wealth) effectively ground abstract concepts in relatable scenarios. The toy model with intelligence and conscientiousness particularly illuminates why extreme values in one factor don't guarantee extreme outcomes.

## Weakness
The main weakness is the post's excessive length and repetition. The same point is made multiple times with only slight variations, and the numerous scatter plot examples add little after the first one. The technical asides and footnotes, while thorough, distract from the core argument. The EA relevance section feels tacked on and doesn't meaningfully extend the analysis.
