## Spelling Errors, Typos, and Grammatical Mistakes Found:

### 1. **Line 15** - Grammar error
> "Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing..."

**Issue**: Incorrect use of "although" with "but" - these conjunctions shouldn't be used together.
**Should be**: "Although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, focusing..." OR "Maybe having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing..."

### 2. **Line 23** - Typo/repetition
> "comparing the speed of a ball out of a baseball pitchers hand compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate:"

**Issue**: Word "crossing" is repeated twice
**Should be**: "compared to its speed crossing the plate:"

### 3. **Line 23** - Missing possessive apostrophe
> "out of a baseball pitchers hand"

**Issue**: Missing apostrophe in "pitchers"
**Should be**: "out of a baseball pitcher's hand"

### 4. **Line 75** - Missing closing apostrophe and grammatical issue
> "Grant a factor correlated with an outcome, which we represent with two vectors at an angle theta, the inverse cosine equal the R-squared. 'Reading off..."

**Issue**: Opening apostrophe before "Reading" has no closing apostrophe, and the sentence structure is awkward
**Should be**: The opening apostrophe should be removed or the quotation should be properly closed

### 5. **Line 87** - Capitalization error
> "if Bill Gates is ~+4SD in intelligence, despite being the richest man in america,"

**Issue**: "america" should be capitalized
**Should be**: "America"

### 6. **Line 99** - Typo
> "why you can by R-squared to move between z-scores"

**Issue**: "by" should be "buy" or more likely "multiply by"
**Should be**: "why you can multiply by R-squared to move between z-scores"
