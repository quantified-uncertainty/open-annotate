## Factual Accuracy Analysis of "Why the tails fall apart"

### 1. **NBA Average Height Claim (Line 7)**
- **Claim**: "the average height in the NBA is around 6'7""
- **Issue**: The Wikipedia link provided leads to a non-existent page. The current URL structure for NBA statistics on Wikipedia is different.
- **Verification**: NBA average height has varied over time but 6'7" (201 cm) is approximately correct for recent decades, though the broken link undermines credibility.

### 2. **Statistical Population Frequencies (Line 59, Line 75)**
- **Claim**: "with 10 people at +4SD, around 500 at +3SD" 
- **Issue**: This ratio is mathematically incorrect. In a normal distribution:
  - +4SD: approximately 1 in 15,787
  - +3SD: approximately 1 in 741
  - The ratio should be roughly 21:1, not 50:1 as stated
- **Additional claim (Line 75)**: "+4SD (~1/15000)" and "+2SD (~1/40)"
  - +4SD is closer to 1/15,787 (reasonably accurate)
  - +2SD is actually ~1/44 (close enough)

### 3. **R-squared and Angle Relationship (Line 75)**
- **Claim**: "an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of sixty degrees)"
- **Issue**: This is incorrect. R-squared = cos²(θ), so:
  - If R² = 0.5, then cos(θ) = √0.5 ≈ 0.707
  - θ = arccos(0.707) ≈ 45 degrees, not 60 degrees
  - For 60 degrees: cos(60°) = 0.5, so R² would be 0.25

### 4. **Geometric Correlation Explanation (Line 71)**
- **Claim**: "The R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle between them when presented as vectors"
- **Issue**: This is imprecise. The correlation coefficient r (not R²) equals the cosine of the angle between centered vectors. R² would be cos²(θ).

### 5. **Statistical Inference About Bill Gates (Line 87)**
- **Claim**: "if Bill Gates is ~+4SD in intelligence, despite being the richest man in america, he is 'merely' in the smartest tens of thousands"
- **Issue**: The math doesn't support "tens of thousands" - at +4SD in a US population of ~330 million, this would be approximately 20,000 people, which is borderline for "tens of thousands" (plural implies at least 20,000+).
