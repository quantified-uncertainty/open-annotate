## Clarity and Readability Analysis

### 1. **Line 9 - Overly complex sentence structure**
> "Although 6'7" is very tall, it lies within a [couple of standard deviations](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=male+height+distribution) of the median US adult male height - there are many thousands of US men taller than the average NBA player, yet are not in the NBA."

**Issue**: This sentence tries to convey multiple ideas at once using dashes and subclauses, making it hard to follow.
**Suggestion**: Break into two sentences for clarity.

### 2. **Line 15 - Unclear phrasing and redundant qualifiers**
> "Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing too heavily on one's serve counterproductively neglects other areas of one's game."

**Issue**: The construction "Maybe although...but" is grammatically awkward and confusing.
**Suggestion**: Simplify to "Maybe having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing too heavily..."

### 3. **Line 23 - Typo and repetition**
> "comparing the speed of a ball out of a baseball pitchers hand compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate:"

**Issue**: Missing apostrophe in "pitchers" and duplicate word "crossing".

### 4. **Line 75 - Dense technical explanation**
> "Grant a factor correlated with an outcome, which we represent with two vectors at an angle theta, the inverse cosine equal the R-squared. 'Reading off the expected outcome given a factor score is just moving along the factor vector and multiplying by cosine theta to get the distance along the outcome vector."

**Issue**: Multiple mathematical concepts crammed into run-on sentences without clear transitions.
**Suggestion**: Break down into simpler steps with clearer connections between concepts.

### 5. **Line 89 - Unnecessarily complex nested clarification**
> "It is also worth clarifying the 'envelope' is only meant to illustrate the shape of the distribution, rather than some boundary that contains the entire probability density: as suggested by [homunq](/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/b6hs): it is an 'pdf isobar' where probability density is higher inside the line than outside it."

**Issue**: Triple nested clarification with colons makes this very hard to parse.
**Suggestion**: Restructure as separate sentences with clearer logical flow.

### 6. **Line 57 - Latin phrase without clear necessity**
> "So, [_ceteris paribus_](/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/b8ph), being more intelligent will make one richer..."

**Issue**: Use of Latin phrase "ceteris paribus" may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.
**Suggestion**: Replace with plain English "all else being equal" or add brief explanation.

### 7. **Line 61 - Run-on sentence with complex comparisons**
> "Although a +4SD intelligence person will likely be better than a given +3SD intelligence person (the mean conscientiousness in both populations is 0SD, and so the average wealth of the +4SD intelligence population is 1SD higher than the 3SD intelligence people), the wealthiest of the +4SDs will not be as good as the best of the much larger number of +3SDs."

**Issue**: Extremely long sentence with multiple parenthetical insertions and technical comparisons.
**Suggestion**: Break into 2-3 sentences with clearer structure.
