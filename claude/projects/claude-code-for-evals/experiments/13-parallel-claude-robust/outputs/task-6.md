## Findings: Missing Context, Undefined Terms, and Incomplete Explanations

### 1. **Undefined technical term: "the tails" (Line 9)**
- **Quote**: "What's interesting is what happens to these relationships 'out on the tail'"
- **Issue**: The phrase "out on the tail" is used without first defining what "tails" means in a statistical context. Readers unfamiliar with statistical distributions may not understand this refers to the extreme ends of a distribution.

### 2. **Unexplained abbreviation: "SD" (Lines 9, 59, 61)**
- **Quote**: "their cognitive ability is around +3 to +4 SD above the mean" (Line 9)
- **Issue**: "SD" (standard deviation) is used repeatedly without being defined. The document assumes statistical literacy that may not be present in all readers.

### 3. **Missing context for "ceteris paribus" (Line 57)**
- **Quote**: "So, [_ceteris paribus_](/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/b8ph), being more intelligent will make one richer"
- **Issue**: This Latin phrase meaning "all other things being equal" is used without translation or explanation, and includes a broken link that might have provided context.

### 4. **Undefined acronym: "EA" (Line 77)**
- **Quote**: "**Endnote: EA relevance**"
- **Issue**: EA (Effective Altruism) is used in the section header without being spelled out or explained, despite being central to the endnote's relevance.

### 5. **Incomplete explanation of "R-square" (Lines 27, 71, 75)**
- **Quote**: "I'd guess the R-square is > 0.8" (Line 27)
- **Issue**: R-square is introduced casually without explaining what it measures (proportion of variance explained) or why values closer to 1 indicate stronger correlation.

### 6. **Undefined abbreviation: "AMF" (Line 83)**
- **Quote**: "perhaps instead of funding AMF to diminishing returns"
- **Issue**: AMF (presumably Against Malaria Foundation) is mentioned without explanation, assuming familiarity with EA organizations.

### 7. **Missing context for "multivariate CLT" (Line 89)**
- **Quote**: "this depends on something like multivariate CLT"
- **Issue**: CLT (Central Limit Theorem) and its multivariate version are referenced without explanation, assuming advanced statistical knowledge.

### 8. **Unexplained term: "pdf isobar" (Line 89)**
- **Quote**: "it is an 'pdf isobar' where probability density is higher inside the line"
- **Issue**: The term "pdf isobar" (probability density function isobar) is introduced in quotes without proper definition or analogy to help readers understand the concept.
