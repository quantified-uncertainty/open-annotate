# Experiment 03: Simple Iterative Evaluation

**Type**: Basic iterative approach  
**Purpose**: Test the iterative pattern with real API calls

## Files
- `iterative-demo.sh` - 4-iteration evaluation script
- `simple-test.sh` - Simplified 3-iteration version
- `input.md` - Test blog post
- `working_document.md` - 315-line working document showing all 6 iterations

## Results
- Completed 6 iterations successfully
- Each iteration added specific analysis
- Working document shows clear progression
- Estimated cost: ~$0.70
- More thorough than single-shot approach
