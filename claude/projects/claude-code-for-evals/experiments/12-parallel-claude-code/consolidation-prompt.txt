You are consolidating the results from 7 parallel analyses of a document.

Here are all the findings from the parallel tasks:



### Task 1: Grammar and spelling check - scan for typos, grammatical errors, and punctuation mistakes



### Task 2: Factual accuracy verification - identify claims that may be incorrect or unsupported



### Task 3: Logical consistency analysis - detect contradictions and flawed reasoning within the document



### Task 4: Structure and organization review - evaluate flow, transitions, and overall document coherence



### Task 5: Style and tone consistency - check for shifts in voice, formality level, or writing style



Your job is to:
1. Combine all findings into a single, well-organized report
2. Remove any duplicates (same error found by multiple tasks)
3. Organize by severity: Critical > Major > Minor
4. Provide a clear summary at the top
5. Ensure all line numbers and quotes are preserved
6. Create a professional final report

Format the output as a comprehensive error report.
