  "output": "[FINDING]\nCategory: mathematical_error\nSeverity: critical\nLine: 71\nQuote: \"The R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle\"\nIssue: This is incorrect. The correlation coefficient R (not R²) equals the cosine of the angle between centered vectors. R-squared is the square of the correlation coefficient.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: major\nLine: 39\nQuote: \"envelope of the distribution should form some sort of *ellipse*\"\nIssue: Missing mathematical justification for why correlated distributions form ellipses. This requires explanation of bivariate normal distributions and their level curves.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: major\nLine: 57\nQuote: \"Let's also say these are equally important to the outcome, independent of one another and are normally distributed\"\nIssue: Missing mathematical formulation of the model. Should specify how factors combine (e.g., W = αI + βC where α = β = 0.5) and what \"equally important\" means mathematically.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: major\nLine: 89\nQuote: \"this depends on something like multivariate CLT\"\nIssue: Missing explanation of what multivariate CLT is and how it applies to the ellipse shape claim. This is a critical mathematical foundation.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: critical\nLine: 59\nQuote: \"with 10 people at +4SD, you wouldn't expect any of them to be +2SD in conscientiousness\"\nIssue: Missing statistical calculation. The probability of at least one person being +2SD given 10 independent samples is 1-(1-0.0228)^10 ≈ 0.21, not negligible.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: major\nLine: 75\nQuote: \"the inverse cosine equal the R-squared\"\nIssue: Missing clarification that this should be \"the angle whose cosine equals R (not R-squared)\". Also missing derivation of the vector representation.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: major\nLine: 75\nQuote: \"an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of sixty degrees)\"\nIssue: Missing calculation. If R² = 0.5, then R ≈ 0.707, and arccos(0.707) ≈ 45°, not 60°.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 89\nQuote: \"the envelope be _concave_\"\nIssue: Missing precise definition of \"concave\" in this context. Should specify whether this means the level curves of the probability density function.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: major\nLine: 95\nQuote: \"one would need to take whatever component of the factors which are independent of one another\"\nIssue: Missing explanation of orthogonalization procedure or how to extract independent components from correlated factors.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 99\nQuote: \"why you can by R-squared to move between z-scores\"\nIssue: Likely typo (\"by\" should be \"multiply by\"), but also missing the complete formula: E[Y|X=x] = ρ(x-μₓ)σᵧ/σₓ + μᵧ.\n[/FINDING]",
