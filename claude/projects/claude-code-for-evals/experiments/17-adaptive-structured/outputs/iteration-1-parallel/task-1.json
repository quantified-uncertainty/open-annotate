  "output": "[FINDING]\nCategory: mathematical_error\nSeverity: critical\nLine: 71\nQuote: \"The R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle between them when presented as vectors in N-dimensional space\"\nIssue: This is incorrect. The correlation coefficient R (not R²) equals the cosine of the angle between centered vectors. R² would be cos²(θ), not cos(θ).\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: mathematical_error\nSeverity: critical\nLine: 75\nQuote: \"Grant a factor correlated with an outcome, which we represent with two vectors at an angle theta, the inverse cosine equal the R-squared.\"\nIssue: This contradicts line 71 and is also incorrect. The angle θ = arccos(R), not arccos(R²). The inverse cosine equals the correlation coefficient R, not R-squared.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: logical_flaw\nSeverity: major\nLine: 61\nQuote: \"the average wealth of the +4SD intelligence population is 1SD higher than the 3SD intelligence people\"\nIssue: This contradicts the earlier setup where intelligence and conscientiousness were said to be \"equally important\" to wealth. If both factors contribute equally and independently, a 1SD difference in one factor should yield 0.5SD difference in outcome, not 1SD.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: logical_flaw\nSeverity: major\nLine: 59\nQuote: \"with 10 people at +4SD, you wouldn't expect any of them to be +2SD in conscientiousness\"\nIssue: This reasoning is flawed. If the factors are truly independent as stipulated, each person has the same probability of being +2SD in conscientiousness regardless of the population size at their intelligence level.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: mathematical_error\nSeverity: major\nLine: 99\nQuote: \"Another intuitive dividend is that this makes it clear why you can by R-squared to move between z-scores of correlated normal variables\"\nIssue: You multiply by R (the correlation coefficient), not R², to convert z-scores between correlated normal variables. The expected z-score of Y given X is R times the z-score of X.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 23\nQuote: \"comparing the speed of a ball out of a baseball pitchers hand compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate\"\nIssue: Redundant use of \"comparing\" and \"compared\", and duplicate word \"crossing\".\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: missing_content\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 83\nQuote: \"There may be spread betting or portfolio scenarios where this factor comes into play - perhaps instead of funding AMF to diminishing returns when its marginal effectiveness dips below charity #2, we should be willing to spread funds sooner.(6)\"\nIssue: Footnote 6 referenced here appears to be about R² and z-scores (line 99), not about portfolio allocation strategies. The relevant footnote appears to be missing.\n[/FINDING]",
