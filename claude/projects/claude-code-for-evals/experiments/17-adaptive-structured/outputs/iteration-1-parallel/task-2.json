  "output": "[FINDING]\nCategory: mathematical_error\nSeverity: critical\nLine: 71\nQuote: \"The R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle between them when presented as vectors in N-dimensional space\"\nIssue: This is incorrect. The correlation coefficient R (not R²) equals the cosine of the angle between centered vectors. R² is the square of the correlation coefficient.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: mathematical_error\nSeverity: critical\nLine: 75\nQuote: \"Grant a factor correlated with an outcome, which we represent with two vectors at an angle theta, the inverse cosine equal the R-squared.\"\nIssue: The angle theta's cosine equals R (the correlation coefficient), not R². The inverse cosine (arccos) of R gives the angle, not the inverse cosine of R².\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: factual_error\nSeverity: major\nLine: 75\nQuote: \"an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of sixty degrees)\"\nIssue: An R² of 0.5 means R ≈ 0.707, which corresponds to an angle of approximately 45 degrees, not 60 degrees. A 60-degree angle would give cos(60°) = 0.5, meaning R = 0.5 and R² = 0.25.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: factual_error\nSeverity: major\nLine: 87\nQuote: \"if Bill Gates is ~+4SD in intelligence, despite being the richest man in america\"\nIssue: Bill Gates has not been the richest person in America for several years. As of the document's 2014 date and updates, this claim was becoming outdated.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: unsupported_claim\nSeverity: major\nLine: 15\nQuote: \"Maybe a high IQ is good for earning money, but a stratospherically high IQ has an increased risk of productivity-reducing mental illness\"\nIssue: The linked source does not provide robust empirical evidence for increased mental illness at very high IQ levels. This claim requires stronger scientific support.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: mathematical_error\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 99\nQuote: \"Another intuitive dividend is that this makes it clear why you can by R-squared to move between z-scores of correlated normal variables\"\nIssue: The text appears to have a typo (\"can by\" should likely be \"can multiply by\"), but more importantly, you multiply by R (not R²) to convert between z-scores of correlated variables.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: spelling_grammar\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 23\nQuote: \"comparing the speed of a ball out of a baseball pitchers hand compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate\"\nIssue: Word repetition error - \"crossing\" appears twice.\n[/FINDING]",
