  "output": "[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 23\nQuote: \"comparing the speed of a ball out of a baseball pitchers hand compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate\"\nIssue: Redundant use of \"compared\" and \"comparing\" makes the sentence awkward. Also contains duplicated word \"crossing crossing\".\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: major\nLine: 27\nQuote: \"Look at this data (again convenience sampled from googling 'scatter plot') of this:\"\nIssue: Sentence ends with \"of this:\" but provides no completion, making it unclear what the data represents.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 15\nQuote: \"Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing too heavily on one's serve counterproductively neglects other areas of one's game.\"\nIssue: Awkward sentence structure with \"Maybe although\" followed by \"but\" creates confusion. Should be restructured for clarity.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: major\nLine: 75\nQuote: \"Grant a factor correlated with an outcome, which we represent with two vectors at an angle theta, the inverse cosine equal the R-squared.\"\nIssue: Missing verb and awkward phrasing makes this sentence difficult to parse. Should clarify the relationship between inverse cosine and R-squared.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 75\nQuote: \"'Reading off the expected outcome given a factor score is just moving along the factor vector and multiplying by cosine theta to get the distance along the outcome vector.\"\nIssue: Starting a sentence with a quoted phrase ('Reading off) is awkward and unclear.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: major\nLine: 57\nQuote: \"So, [_ceteris paribus_](/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/b8ph), being more intelligent will make one richer\"\nIssue: Latin term \"ceteris paribus\" with no explanation provided, and it's formatted as a link which adds confusion about whether it's meant to be explanatory.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 83\nQuote: \"There may be spread betting or portfolio scenarios where this factor comes into play - perhaps instead of funding AMF to diminishing returns when its marginal effectiveness dips below charity #2, we should be willing to spread funds sooner.(6)\"\nIssue: Uses acronym \"AMF\" without prior definition, making it unclear for readers unfamiliar with this charity.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: major\nLine: 89\nQuote: \"I'm pretty sure this can be weakened: all that is needed, by the lights of my graphical intuition, is that the envelope be _concave_.\"\nIssue: The phrase \"by the lights of my graphical intuition\" is unnecessarily convoluted and unclear.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 99\nQuote: \"Another intuitive dividend is that this makes it clear why you can by R-squared to move between z-scores\"\nIssue: Missing verb - should be \"multiply by R-squared\" or similar. The omission makes the sentence confusing.\n[/FINDING]\n\n[FINDING]\nCategory: clarity_issue\nSeverity: minor\nLine: 17\nQuote: \"the tallest aren't the heaviest, the smartest parents don't have the smartest children, the fastest runners aren't the best footballers, etc. etc.\"\nIssue: Double \"etc.\" is redundant and informal.\n[/FINDING]",
