# Comparison of Parallel Claude Approaches

## Experiment 12: Basic Parallel
- **Approach**: Claude decomposes → parallel tasks → consolidate
- **Pros**: Simple, works well when it works
- **Cons**: No error handling, can fail completely

## Experiment 13: Robust Parallel
- **Approach**: Same as 12 but with timeouts, retries, fallbacks
- **Result**: All 6 tasks completed in 23-36 seconds each!
- **Pros**: Reliable, handles failures gracefully
- **Cons**: Still deterministic (always 6 tasks)

## Experiment 14: Multi-Stage Short Tasks
- **Approach**: Multiple stages of 4-minute tasks
- **Pros**: Very reliable, progressive enhancement
- **Cons**: More complex, still fairly rigid

## Experiment 15: Adaptive Orchestration
- **Approach**: Claude acts as PM, decides strategy each iteration
- **Pros**: 
  - Truly adaptive
  - Can stop early if sufficient
  - Can dig deeper where needed
  - Transparent decision making
- **Cons**: 
  - More complex
  - More Claude API calls for planning
  - Less predictable runtime

## Key Insights

1. **Task Duration Matters**: 23-36 second tasks (Exp 13) worked perfectly vs 10+ minute timeouts

2. **Focused Prompts Win**: "Find spelling errors with line numbers" > "Analyze this document"  

3. **Parallelization Works**: 6 tasks in 59 seconds vs 16 minutes sequential

4. **Adaptability Has Value**: Being able to dig deeper or stop early based on findings

## Recommendations

- **For simple analysis**: Use Experiment 13 (robust parallel)
- **For complex/unknown documents**: Use Experiment 15 (adaptive)
- **For production**: Combine approaches - start with robust parallel, add adaptive refinement if needed
