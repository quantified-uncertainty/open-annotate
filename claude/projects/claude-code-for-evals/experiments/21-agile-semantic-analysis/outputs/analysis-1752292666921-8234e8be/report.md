## Findings by Section

### Document Start
**10 finding(s)**

- **Line 7**: Factual claim - "the average height in the NBA is around 6'7"
  - *NBA average height statistic*

- **Line 8**: Factual claim - "IQ scores are known to predict a slew of factors, from income, to chance of being imprisoned, to lifespan"
  - *IQ correlation with multiple life outcomes*

- **Line 10**: unsupported - "extreme outliers of a given predictor are seldom similarly extreme outliers on the outcome it predicts"
  - *This claim is presented as fact without supporting evidence or citation, despite being the central thesis*

- **Line 11**: Factual claim - "Although 6'7 is very tall, it lies within a couple of standard deviations of the median US adult male height"
  - *Statistical claim about height distribution*

- **Line 11**: fallacy - "there are many thousands of US men taller than the average NBA player, yet are not in the NBA"
  - *This commits the fallacy of reversed causation - height predicts basketball success, but the argument incorrectly assumes all tall people should be in the NBA*

- **Line 12**: Factual claim - "there are many thousands of US men taller than the average NBA player"
  - *Population claim about tall men in US*

- **Line 12**: fallacy - "the very highest earners tend to be very smart, but their intelligence is not in step with their income (their cognitive ability is around +3 to +4 SD above the mean, yet their wealth is much higher than this)"
  - *Comparing standard deviations across different distributions (IQ vs wealth) is mathematically inappropriate - wealth distributions are not normal and have no meaningful SD comparison to IQ*

- **Line 13**: Factual claim - "if you look at the players serving the fastest serves ever recorded, they aren't the very best players of their time"
  - *Tennis performance claim*

- **Line 14**: Factual claim - "the very highest earners tend to be very smart"
  - *Intelligence-income correlation claim*

- **Line 14**: Factual claim - "their cognitive ability is around +3 to +4 SD above the mean"
  - *Specific statistical claim about high earners' IQ*

### Too much of a good thing?
**5 finding(s)**

- **Line 17**: contradiction - "I would guess that these sorts of 'hidden trade-offs' are common. But, the 'divergence of tails' seems pretty ubiquitous... and it would be weird if there was always a 'too much of a good thing' story"
  - *Acknowledges hidden trade-offs are common, then argues it would be weird if they commonly explained the phenomenon*

- **Line 18**: Factual claim - "a stratospherically high IQ has an increased risk of productivity-reducing mental illness"
  - *Association between very high IQ and mental illness risk*

- **Line 20**: Factual claim - "the tallest aren't the heaviest"
  - *Lack of correlation between extreme height and weight*

- **Line 20**: Factual claim - "the smartest parents don't have the smartest children"
  - *Lack of perfect correlation between parent and child intelligence at extremes*

- **Line 20**: Factual claim - "the fastest runners aren't the best footballers"
  - *Lack of correlation between sprinting speed and football performance at elite levels*

### The simple graphical explanation
**9 finding(s)**

- **Line 29**: unsupported - "Given a correlation, the envelope of the distribution should form some sort of *ellipse*, narrower as the correlation goes stronger, and more circular as it gets weaker"
  - *While this is generally true for bivariate normal distributions, the author doesn't establish that the shown examples follow this distribution. Real-world data often violates normality assumptions.*

- **Line 30**: Factual claim - "I'd guess the R-square is > 0.8"
  - *Statistical correlation estimate for baseball pitch speeds*

- **Line 30**: Factual claim - "the very fastest balls out of the hand *aren't* the very fastest balls crossing the plate, and vice versa"
  - *Empirical observation about baseball pitch speeds at extremes*

- **Line 33**: unsupported - "as the ellipse doesn't sharpen to a point, there are bulges where the maximum x and y values lie with sub-maximal y and x values respectively"
  - *This geometric description assumes a specific mathematical form without justification. The "bulges" are a consequence of finite sampling and the mathematical properties of correlation, not an inherent feature of ellipses.*

- **Line 35**: unsupported - "So this offers an explanation why divergence at the tails is ubiquitous."
  - *The author jumps from observing a pattern in scatter plots to claiming this explains a ubiquitous phenomenon without establishing that all correlations follow this exact pattern or that this is the primary mechanism.*

- **Line 39**: unsupported - "Hence the very best basketball players aren't the very tallest (and vice versa), the very wealthiest not the very smartest"
  - *These real-world examples may have multiple confounding factors beyond simple correlation mechanics. The author assumes a single mathematical explanation for complex multivariate phenomena.*

- **Line 42**: Factual claim - "Given a correlation, the envelope of the distribution should form some sort of *ellipse*"
  - *Mathematical/statistical principle about correlation distributions*

- **Line 50**: Factual claim - "the very best basketball players aren't the very tallest (and vice versa)"
  - *Empirical claim about basketball player height and performance*

- **Line 50**: Factual claim - "the very wealthiest not the very smartest"
  - *Empirical claim about correlation between wealth and intelligence*

### An intuitive explanation of the graphical explanation
**8 finding(s)**

- **Line 51**: Factual claim - "being tall matters for being good at basketball"
  - *Claim about physical attribute importance in sports*

- **Line 51**: Factual claim - "strength, agility, hand-eye-coordination matter as well"
  - *Claim about additional factors important for basketball*

- **Line 52**: Factual claim - "being smart helps in getting rich"
  - *Claim about intelligence contributing to wealth*

- **Line 52**: Factual claim - "so does being hard working, being lucky"
  - *Claim about additional factors contributing to wealth*

- **Line 56**: Factual claim - "with 10 people at +4SD, you wouldn't expect any of them to be +2SD in conscientiousness"
  - *Statistical claim about probability at extreme values*

- **Line 58**: Factual claim - "if 10 at +4SD, around 500 at +3SD"
  - *Statistical claim about population distribution*

- **Line 60**: unsupported - "with 10 people at +4SD, you wouldn't expect any of them to be +2SD in conscientiousness"
  - *The claim that you wouldn't expect any of 10 people at +4SD intelligence to be +2SD in conscientiousness lacks mathematical justification. Even with independent variables, there's a calculable probability (~2.3%) that any individual would be +2SD in conscientiousness, making it plausible that at least one of 10 people could achieve this.*

- **Line 62**: unsupported - "if 10 at +4SD, around 500 at +3SD"
  - *The ratio of 50:1 between +3SD and +4SD populations is stated without justification. While +3SD is indeed more common than +4SD in a normal distribution, the specific ratio should be calculated based on the normal distribution properties rather than assumed.*

### A parallel geometric explanation
**17 finding(s)**

- **Line 71**: Factual claim - "The R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle between them when presented as vectors in N-dimensional space"
  - *Mathematical relationship between R-square and cosine*

- **Line 79**: Factual claim - "As cos theta is never greater than 1"
  - *Mathematical property of cosine function*

- **Line 81**: Factual claim - "the gap between extreme values of a factor and the less extreme values of the outcome grows linearly as the factor value gets more extreme"
  - *Linear growth relationship*

- **Line 81**: unsupported - "an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of sixty degrees)"
  - *R-squared of 0.5 corresponds to an angle of 45 degrees, not 60 degrees (since cos(45°) = √0.5)*

- **Line 82**: unsupported - "an R-square of 0.5... means that +4SD (~1/15000) on a factor will be expected to be 'merely' +2SD (~1/40) in the outcome"
  - *With R-squared of 0.5, the correlation R = √0.5 ≈ 0.707, so +4SD on the factor corresponds to +2.83SD on the outcome, not +2SD*

- **Line 84**: Factual claim - "an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of sixty degrees)"
  - *Specific R-square to angle conversion*

- **Line 84**: Factual claim - "+4SD (~1/15000)"
  - *Statistical frequency of 4 standard deviations*

- **Line 85**: Factual claim - "+2SD (~1/40)"
  - *Statistical frequency of 2 standard deviations*

- **Line 86**: Factual claim - "an R-square of 0.5 is remarkably strong in the social sciences"
  - *Field-specific interpretation of R-square value*

- **Line 86**: Factual claim - "implying it accounts for half the variance"
  - *R-square of 0.5 accounting for half of variance*

- **Line 105**: Factual claim - "income isn't normally distributed"
  - *Statistical property of income distribution*

- **Line 105**: Factual claim - "if Bill Gates is ~+4SD in intelligence"
  - *Claim about Bill Gates' intelligence level*

- **Line 107**: Factual claim - "generally modest achievements of people in high-IQ societies"
  - *Generalization about high-IQ society members*

- **Line 110**: Factual claim - "this depends on something like multivariate CLT"
  - *Mathematical dependency claim*

- **Line 117**: Factual claim - "The old faithful case is an example where actually you do get a 'point'"
  - *Specific example about Old Faithful data*

- **Line 119**: unsupported - "My intuition is that in cartesian coordinates the R-square between correlated X and Y is actually also the cosine of the angle between the regression lines of X on Y and Y on X"
  - *This mathematical claim is incorrect - R-squared is not the cosine of the angle between regression lines*

- **Line 122**: unsupported - "this makes it clear why you can by R-squared to move between z-scores of correlated normal variables"
  - *You multiply by R (correlation coefficient), not R-squared, to convert between z-scores of correlated variables*
