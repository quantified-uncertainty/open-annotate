### Key Claims Identified
1. Height correlates with basketball performance (avg NBA height 6'7")
2. Extreme outliers in predictors rarely match extreme outliers in outcomes
3. The "tails come apart" - correlations weaken at extremes
4. Multiple factors contribute to outcomes (not just one predictor)
5. R-squared relates to cosine of angle between vectors`,
    nextFocus: "Verify statistical claims"
  },
  {
    task: "Verify statistical claims",
    findings: `
### Statistical Verification
- ‚úì NBA average height claim appears accurate
- ‚úì R-squared as cosine relationship is mathematically sound
- ‚úì Normal distribution assumptions are clearly stated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some claims lack specific citations (e.g., IQ-income correlation)`,
    nextFocus: "Evaluate logical coherence"
  },
  {
    task: "Evaluate logical coherence",
    findings: `
### Logical Analysis
- Strong: Clear progression from observation to explanation
- Strong: Multiple explanatory models (graphical, intuitive, geometric)
- Weakness: Jump from correlation to causation in some examples
- Note: Toy model assumptions may oversimplify real relationships`,
    nextFocus: "Assess clarity and accessibility"
  },
  {
    task: "Assess clarity and accessibility",
    findings: `
### Clarity Assessment
- Excellent use of concrete examples (NBA, tennis, IQ)
- Good visual aids with scatter plots
- Technical concepts well-explained for general audience
- Minor issue: Some statistical jargon not fully defined
- EA relevance section feels somewhat tacked on`,
    nextFocus: "Generate final evaluation"
