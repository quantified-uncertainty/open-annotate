Let me analyze this blog post section by section:

1. Mathematical/Logical Errors:
- No significant mathematical errors noted
- The statistical references appear sound
- The logic of correlation vs. extreme cases is well-reasoned

2. Factual Inaccuracies:
- The NBA average height citation (6'7") appears accurate
- The tennis serve speed and IQ correlation citations seem accurate
- The links provided support the claims made

3. Typos/Grammatical Issues:
- Inconsistent quotation mark usage: both single and double quotes are used
- Some minor stylistic issues with parentheses placement
- "out on the tail" should probably be "out in the tail" (common usage)
- Some informal language that might not suit a technical blog post ("pretty good predictors")

4. Contradictions/Unclear Reasoning:
- The post introduces "(1)" at the end but doesn't follow up with the reference
- The basketball height example could be clearer about causation vs. correlation
- The post promises a geometric explanation (in the edit note) but doesn't provide it in this excerpt

Overall Suggestions:
1. Standardize quotation mark usage
2. Complete or remove the "(1)" reference
3. Add the promised geometric explanation
4. Consider more formal language in places
5. Clarify whether this is meant to be a complete post or if there's more content

The core argument appears sound, but the presentation could be tightened up for clarity and completeness.
