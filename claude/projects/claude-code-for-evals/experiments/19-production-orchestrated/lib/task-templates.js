const FINDING_FORMAT = `
[FINDING]
Category: [choose one: spelling_grammar | mathematical_error | logical_flaw | factual_error | clarity_issue | structural_problem | missing_content]
Severity: [choose one: critical | major | minor]
Line: [line number]
Quote: "[exact quote from document]"
Issue: [clear description of the problem]

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Output each finding in the EXACT format shown below
2. Use ONLY the predefined categories and severities
3. Include the EXACT line number where the issue occurs
4. Quote the EXACT text from the document
5. Provide a clear, specific description of the issue

Format for EACH finding:
${FINDING_FORMAT}

Example:
[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_error
Severity: critical
Line: 71
Quote: "The R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle"
Issue: This is incorrect. The correlation coefficient R (not RÂ²) equals the cosine of the angle between centered vectors.
[/FINDING]

IMPORTANT: 
- Output NOTHING except findings in this format
- Do not include any explanatory text outside of findings
- Each finding must be complete and self-contained`;
