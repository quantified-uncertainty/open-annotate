# Fixes Applied to Experiment 19

Based on issues found in experiment 18's recent run, the following fixes have been applied:

## 1. GNU Parallel TTY Warnings
- **Issue**: Parallel was showing "/dev/tty" warnings
- **Fix**: Added `--no-notice` flag to parallel command in `orchestrate-analysis.sh`
- **Also**: Added `grep -v "/dev/tty"` filter in `test-system.sh`

## 2. Claude Thinking It's 2024 
- **Issue**: Analysis thought Q3 2024 data was "future" data when it's actually 2025
- **Fix**: Added current date context to all prompts:
  - `lib/create-prompts.js` - Added `Today's date is ${currentDate}` context
  - `lib/create-synthesis-prompt.js` - Added date context
  - `lib/create-short-synthesis-prompt.js` - Added date context

## 3. Source URL Preservation
- **Issue**: Web search source URLs weren't being preserved through synthesis
- **Fix**: Enhanced source URL handling:
  - `lib/parse-task-output.js` - Extracts source URLs from issue text into `sourceUrl` field
  - `lib/create-synthesis-prompt.js` - Shows source URLs in findings list
  - `lib/create-short-synthesis-prompt.js` - Includes source URLs
  - Added explicit instructions to preserve source citations

## 4. Script Directory Reference
- **Issue**: Undefined $SCRIPT_DIR variable in cost report generation
- **Fix**: Changed to direct path `lib/track-usage.js` instead of `$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/track-usage.js`

## 5. Factual Verification Task Completion
- **Issue**: factual_verification task was incomplete in experiment 18
- **Fix**: The timeout is already set to 600 seconds (10 minutes) which should be sufficient
- **Note**: If tasks still timeout, can increase TIMEOUT_PER_TASK in orchestrate-analysis.sh

## Testing

To verify these fixes work:

```bash
# Run the test system
./test-system.sh

# Or run a full analysis
./orchestrate-analysis.sh comprehensive-test.md
```

## 6. Updated Model References to Claude 4
- **Issue**: Code was referencing Claude 3/3.5 models instead of Claude 4
- **Fix**: Updated all model references:
  - `lib/track-usage.js` - Changed from `claude-3-sonnet` to `claude-4-sonnet`
  - `lib/estimate-costs.js` - Updated default model to `claude-4-sonnet`
  - Updated pricing tables to reflect Claude 4 models
  - Updated README to reference "Claude 4 Sonnet pricing"
- **Note**: Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet pricing as estimate for Claude 4 Sonnet

## 7. Fixed Parallel Execution Variable Error
- **Issue**: `TASK_ID: unbound variable` error during parallel execution
- **Root Cause**: Variable expansion issues within GNU parallel's command string
- **Fix**: Created a separate helper script (`run-task.sh`) to handle task execution
  - Avoids complex variable expansion within parallel command
  - Passes parameters as arguments instead of relying on environment
  - More robust error handling

## 8. JavaScript Orchestrator Alternative
- **Issue**: Bash script complexity causing variable binding and error handling issues
- **Solution**: Created `orchestrate-analysis.js` as a pure JavaScript alternative
- **Benefits**:
  - Better error handling with proper try/catch
  - Clean async/await parallel execution
  - No more shell variable expansion issues
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Easier debugging with stack traces
  - Maintains exact same functionality as bash version
- **Usage**: Can use either `./orchestrate-analysis.js` or original `./orchestrate-analysis.sh`

## Expected Improvements

1. No more GNU Parallel warnings cluttering output
2. Correct understanding that it's 2025, not 2024
3. Source URLs preserved in final reports
4. Clean execution without undefined variable errors
5. Better completion rate for factual verification tasks
6. Accurate model references for Claude 4 (Sonnet 4) via Claude Code
7. Reliable parallel task execution without variable binding errors
8. Optional JavaScript orchestrator for better reliability and debugging
