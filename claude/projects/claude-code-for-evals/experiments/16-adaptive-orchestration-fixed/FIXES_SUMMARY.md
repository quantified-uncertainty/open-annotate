# Summary of Fixes Applied

## 1. ✅ Fixed Output File Storage
**Problem**: Task outputs weren't being saved due to environment variable issues in parallel execution.

**Solution**: 
- Tasks now write to structured JSON files with metadata
- Output directory is passed via file communication instead of environment variables
- Each task writes to `outputs/iteration-N-parallel/task-M.json`

## 2. ✅ Improved Findings Parser
**Problem**: Naive parser was picking up any line with "line" or "error", creating garbage findings.

**Solution**:
- Created structured parser (`lib/findings-parser.js`) that:
  - Extracts actual findings with line numbers
  - Categorizes by type (spelling, factual, logical, etc.)
  - Assigns severity (critical, major, minor)
  - Preserves quotes and context

## 3. ✅ Better Task Communication
**Problem**: Task descriptions were being cut off at pipe characters.

**Solution**:
- Changed delimiter from `|` to `§§§` for GNU parallel
- Tasks are written to JSONL file for reliable parsing
- Each task gets full description without truncation

## 4. ✅ Structured Data Flow
**Problem**: Unstructured text parsing led to poor quality findings.

**Solution**:
- Task outputs are JSON with metadata
- Findings have consistent structure
- State tracking uses proper JSON schemas

## 5. ✅ Validated Synthesis
**Problem**: Synthesis was working with corrupted findings data.

**Solution**:
- Synthesis now works with structured findings
- Groups by severity and category
- Produces statistical summaries

## Test Results

Running `./test-fixes.sh` shows:
- ✅ Tasks execute successfully (24-32 seconds each)
- ✅ Output files are created properly 
- ✅ Findings are parsed with structure (14 findings extracted)
- ✅ State is updated correctly

## Usage

```bash
# Run a single iteration test
./orchestrator.sh --max-iterations 1

# Run full adaptive orchestration
./orchestrator.sh --max-iterations 3 --time-budget 600
```

The system now properly:
1. Executes parallel tasks
2. Saves structured outputs
3. Parses real findings
4. Updates state correctly
5. Makes informed decisions
6. Produces quality reports
