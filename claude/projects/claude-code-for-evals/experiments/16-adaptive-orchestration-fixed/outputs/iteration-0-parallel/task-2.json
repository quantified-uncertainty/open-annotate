  "rawOutput": "## Mathematical Accuracy Issues in \"Why the tails fall apart\"\n\n1. **Line 9**\n   - Quote: \"Although 6'7\" is very tall, it lies within a couple of standard deviations of the median US adult male height\"\n   - Issue: Statistical calculation error\n   - Severity: **Major**\n   - Description: Average US male height is ~5'9\" (69 inches). 6'7\" is 79 inches, a difference of 10 inches. With standard deviation ~3 inches for male height, 6'7\" is approximately 3.3 standard deviations above mean, not \"a couple\" (which implies ~2).\n\n2. **Line 59**\n   - Quote: \"with 10 people at +4SD, you wouldn't expect any of them to be +2SD in conscientiousness\"\n   - Issue: Incorrect probability calculation\n   - Severity: **Minor**\n   - Description: If variables are independent, each person has ~2.3% chance of being +2SD in conscientiousness. With 10 people, the probability of at least one being +2SD is 1-(0.977)^10 ≈ 20.7%, not negligible.\n\n3. **Line 61**\n   - Quote: \"if 10 at +4SD, around 500 at +3SD\"\n   - Issue: Incorrect ratio between normal distribution tails\n   - Severity: **Major**\n   - Description: The ratio between +4SD and +3SD frequencies is approximately 1:15.8, not 1:50. If 10 people at +4SD, expect ~158 at +3SD, not 500.\n\n4. **Line 71**\n   - Quote: \"The R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle between them when presented as vectors in N-dimensional space\"\n   - Issue: Conflation of R and R²\n   - Severity: **Critical**\n   - Description: The correlation coefficient R (not R²) equals the cosine of the angle between centered vectors. R² is the square of this cosine.\n\n5. **Line 75**\n   - Quote: \"Grant a factor correlated with an outcome, which we represent with two vectors at an angle theta, the inverse cosine equal the R-squared\"\n   - Issue: Mathematical relationship error\n   - Severity: **Critical**\n   - Description: Should be \"angle theta equals arccos(R)\" not \"arccos(R²)\". This error propagates through the geometric explanation.\n\n6. **Line 75**\n   - Quote: \"an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of sixty degrees)\"\n   - Issue: Incorrect angle calculation\n   - Severity: **Critical**\n   - Description: R² = 0.5 means R ≈ 0.707, which corresponds to arccos(0.707) ≈ 45°, not 60°. An angle of 60° would give R = 0.5 and R² = 0.25.\n\n7. **Line 75**\n   - Quote: \"+4SD (~1/15000) on a factor will be expected to be 'merely' +2SD (~1/40)\"\n   - Issue: Incorrect probability values\n   - Severity: **Major**\n   - Description: +4SD corresponds to ~1/31,500 (not 1/15,000) and +2SD to ~1/44 (close to 1/40 but should be more precise in a mathematical context).\n\n8. **Line 99**\n   - Quote: \"you can by R-squared to move between z-scores of correlated normal variables\"\n   - Issue: Typo obscures mathematical claim\n   - Severity: **Minor**\n   - Description: Appears to be missing word \"multiply\" - should likely read \"you can multiply by R-squared\" though this would still be incorrect (should multiply by R, not R²).",
