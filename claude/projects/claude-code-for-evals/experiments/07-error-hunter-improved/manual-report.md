# Error Hunter v2 - Actual Results

## Summary
- **Total Errors Found**: 31
- **Duration**: 15.6 minutes (937.8 seconds)  
- **Total Cost**: $0.33
- **Cost per Error**: $0.011

## Key Findings

### Most Critical Issues (R vs R² Confusion)
1. **Line 71**: Claims "R-square measure...is the same as the cosine" - Should be R, not R²
2. **Line 75**: "inverse cosine equal the R-squared" - Should be R
3. **Line 75**: Claims R² = 0.5 gives 60° angle - Actually gives 45°
4. **Line 99**: "multiply by R-squared to move between z-scores" - Should multiply by R

### Error Breakdown by Category

#### Typos & Grammar (5 errors)
- Repeated word "crossing crossing" (Line 23)
- Missing apostrophe "pitchers hand" (Line 23)  
- Missing spaces before brackets (Lines 7, 9)
- Double conjunction "Maybe although...but" (Line 15)

#### Mathematical Errors (5 errors)
- Pervasive confusion between R and R-squared
- Incorrect angle calculations
- Wrong variance explanations

#### Logical Contradictions (5 errors)
- Trade-offs dismissed then embraced
- Claims both "insoluble" and "limited relevance"
- Contradictory sample size requirements

#### Fact-Checking Issues (5 errors)
- Outdated Bill Gates claim
- Missing population context for statistics
- Unexplained acronyms (AMF)
- Missing temporal context (NBA heights)

#### Citation Problems (11 errors)
- Dead cross-post link
- 9 images without attribution (copyright risk)
- Broken Wikipedia link
- Relative URLs that only work on LessWrong
- Unsupported claims about social science standards

## Improvements vs v1

1. **Better Logging**: Clear timestamps, per-iteration logs, progress tracking
2. **Cost Tracking**: Accurate cost estimation ($0.33 for 31 errors)
3. **File Organization**: Clean structure with logs/, working/, output/ folders
4. **Consistent Output**: All errors properly documented in working document

## Issue to Fix

The error parsing function failed to count errors correctly, showing "0 errors found" in the final report despite finding 31. The working document has all the errors properly documented.
