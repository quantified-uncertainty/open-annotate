I've completed the citation and reference verification task. I found 5 new errors related to citations and references:

1. **Dead link** - The cross-post link to thepolemicalmedic.com appears to be inactive
2. **Copyright issues** - 9 images are used without any attribution or licensing information, potentially violating copyright
3. **Broken Wikipedia link** - The NBA statistics link has malformed URL structure
4. **Incomplete citation** - A relative URL that only works on LessWrong platform
5. **Missing citation** - A claim about R-squared values in social sciences lacks supporting evidence

All 6 iterations are now complete, and the working document has been updated with all findings.
