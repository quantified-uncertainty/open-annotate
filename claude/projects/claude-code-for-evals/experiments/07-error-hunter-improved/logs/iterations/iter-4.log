I've successfully identified 5 logical contradictions in the document and updated the working document. The contradictions I found include:

1. **Trade-offs contradiction** - The author presents trade-offs as an explanation but then dismisses their universality
2. **Practical relevance contradiction** - Claims the issue is both "insoluble" and of "limited practical relevance"
3. **Independence confusion** - Conflates statistical independence with absence of negative correlation
4. **Sample size logic error** - Makes contradictory claims about correlation tightness and sample size requirements
5. **Confidence contradiction** - Claims clarity while admitting inability to demonstrate

The working document has been updated with iteration 4 completed and placeholders added for the remaining iterations.
