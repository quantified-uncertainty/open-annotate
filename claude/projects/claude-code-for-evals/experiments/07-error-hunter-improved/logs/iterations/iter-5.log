I have successfully completed iteration 5 of the error-hunting task, focusing on fact-checking claims about people, organizations, and statistics about groups. I found 5 high-quality errors related to:

1. **Bill Gates claim**: While factually accurate for 2014, it lacks temporal context and becomes outdated
2. **Population statistics**: The numbers lack necessary context about total population size
3. **AMF acronym**: Unexplained EA-specific terminology
4. **NBA height statistic**: Missing temporal context about how this statistic changes over time
5. **Prometheus Society reference**: Unexplained organization reference

The working document has been updated with these findings under the "Iteration 5" section, and is now ready for the final iteration 6 (Verify citations and references).
