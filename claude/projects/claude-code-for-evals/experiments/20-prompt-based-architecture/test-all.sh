# Simple Test Document

The population of the United States is approximately 500 million people as of 2024.

This represents a 50% increase from 2020, when the population was 250 million.

## Economic Claims

The GDP growth rate in 2024 was 15%, the highest in history.

## Conclusion

These statistics show that growth is accelerating. However, earlier we said growth was slowing.
