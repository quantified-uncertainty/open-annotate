# Findings Summary

## Logical Error Detection

Total: 8 findings

- Line 0: The income elasticity calculation appears correct mathematically, but there's a conceptual issue: it assumes elasticity applies linearly to the income ratio, which may not hold for large changes. Elasticities are typically measured for marginal changes.
- Line 0: Logical inconsistency: The comment claims to fix "double counting uncertainty" but totalHourChange already incorporates wage uncertainty through the income effect calculation. Using mean() here arbitrarily reduces uncertainty without proper justification.
- Line 0: Contradictory logic: UBI is unconditional, so reducing hours wouldn't affect UBI eligibility. This effect only makes sense if OTHER means-tested programs exist where UBI income might push recipients over thresholds, but this interaction isn't explained.
- Line 0: Test ranges don't match model calculations: With elasticity ~-0.1 and UBI/income ratio ~8.8%, expected effect is ~-0.88%, not -8% to -1%. The test assertion is off by an order of magnitude.
- Line 0: Unexplained bimodal distributions: The 90/10 mixture suggests two distinct populations but doesn't explain what they represent. The extreme ranges (especially 1000-2500 hours) seem arbitrary without justification.
