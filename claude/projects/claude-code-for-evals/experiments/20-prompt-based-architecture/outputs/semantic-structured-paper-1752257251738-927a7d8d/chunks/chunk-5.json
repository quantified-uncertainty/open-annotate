While classical theory predicts certain relationships, we find that behavioral factors play a significant role.\n\nThe asymmetric response to positive versus negative policy news suggests that loss aversion affects institutional investors, not just retail traders.\n\n### Policy Recommendations\n\nBased on our analysis, we recommend:\n1. Clear communication strategies to reduce uncertainty\n2. Graduated policy changes rather than sudden shifts\n3. Coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities\n\n### Limitations\n\nSeveral limitations should be noted:\n- Our sample period includes an unprecedented global pandemic\n- Survey data may suffer from selection bias\n- Causal identification remains challenging despite our econometric approach\n",
