# Experiment 20 Summary

## What This Is

A complete rewrite of the document analysis system that fixes all the fragility issues from experiment 19.

## Three New Architectures

### 1. Simple Analyzer (`simple-analyzer.js`)
- **300 lines**, single file
- For documents < 50 pages
- No resume capability
- Quick and reliable

### 2. Resumable Analyzer (`resumable-analyzer.js`)
- **600 lines**, single file  
- Chunks documents for unlimited size
- Full job tracking and resume
- Dashboard shows exactly what failed

### 3. Prompt-Based Analyzer (`prompt-based-analyzer.js`)
- **800 lines**, single file
- Library of 10+ analysis prompts
- Tool integration ready
- Most flexible and extensible

## Key Improvements

✅ **No more bash/parallel issues** - Pure JavaScript  
✅ **No more variable binding errors** - Proper async/await  
✅ **Handles any document size** - Smart chunking  
✅ **Resume failed analyses** - State tracking  
✅ **Add analyses without code** - Just add prompts  
✅ **Clear job visibility** - See what failed and why  

## Quick Start

```bash
# Test all three analyzers
./test-all.sh

# Simple analysis
./simple-analyzer.js document.md

# Large document with resume
./resumable-analyzer.js huge-doc.md
# If it fails, resume:
./resumable-analyzer.js huge-doc.md outputs/huge-doc-*/

# Specific analyses with prompts
./prompt-based-analyzer.js doc.md --prompts logical_errors,factual_claims

# See available analyses
./prompt-based-analyzer.js --list
```

## Why This Architecture Works

1. **Single File** - Everything in one place, easy to understand
2. **Job-Based** - Each analysis is an independent job that can fail/retry
3. **Prompt Templates** - Standardized analysis types, easy to add more
4. **Tool Ready** - Prompts can declare tools they need
5. **Structured Output** - Consistent format across all analyses

## Example Output

```
📊 Job Status:
Total Jobs: 30
✅ Completed: 29 (97%)
⏳ Pending: 0
🔄 Running: 0
❌ Failed: 1

Failed Jobs:
- job-15: Timeout after 300s

Resume command: ./prompt-based-analyzer.js "document.md" "outputs/document-12345/"
```

## For Production Use

Use the **prompt-based analyzer**:
- Most battle-tested architecture
- Extensible via prompts
- Tool integration ready
- Best error handling
- Clear cost tracking

## Next Steps

1. Run `./test-all.sh` to verify setup
2. Choose architecture based on needs
3. Run on your documents
4. Customize prompts as needed
5. Process verification requests

This is a production-ready system that solves all the issues from previous experiments!
