I have completed the "Extract key claims" task. I identified and categorized the article's key claims into two main categories:

1. **Empirical Claims** - Including NBA average height, tennis serve speeds, IQ correlations, and specific examples like Bill Gates
2. **Theoretical Claims** - The core argument about tail divergence, multi-factor causation, and the mathematical/geometric explanations

I've updated the working document with:
- Marked the "Extract key claims" task as complete [x]
- Set the next "Current Focus" to "Verify facts"
- Added detailed extraction of claims (approximately 180 words) under "Key Claims Extracted (Iteration 1)"
- Updated the iteration log

The next task "Verify facts" is now set as the current focus for the next iteration.

I've completed the fact verification task. I checked the 5 key claims and found:

1. ‚úì NBA height claim is accurate (6'7")
2. ‚úì Tennis serve claim is verified (fastest servers aren't top players)
3. ~ IQ correlations align with research but sources are dated
4. ‚úó Bill Gates intelligence claim is unverifiable speculation
5. ~ R-square interpretation is generally accurate but slightly overstated

I've updated the document with detailed verification results, marked the task complete, and set "Analyze logic" as the next focus task.

Created final_evaluation.md with a clean, professional evaluation of the article "Why the tails fall apart".
