# Final Evaluation: "Why the tails fall apart"

## Summary of Findings

This article effectively explains a counterintuitive statistical phenomenon: why extreme values in one correlated variable rarely correspond to extreme values in another. Using accessible examples from sports, intelligence, and wealth, the author demonstrates how "tail divergence" occurs even with strong correlations. While the core thesis is sound and well-illustrated, the article would benefit from updated references and more rigorous mathematical treatment.

## Strengths

### Clear Communication
- **Accessible explanations**: Complex statistical concepts are presented through three complementary approaches (graphical, intuitive, and geometric), making the material approachable for various audiences
- **Effective examples**: Real-world cases (NBA height, tennis serves, IQ/wealth) provide concrete illustrations of abstract concepts
- **Transparent limitations**: The author openly acknowledges uncertainty and potential lack of mathematical rigor

### Factual Accuracy
- **Verified claims**: Core empirical examples are factually accurate:
  - NBA average height of 6'7" is confirmed
  - Tennis serve speed patterns (fastest servers aren't top-ranked players) are verified
  - General IQ correlations with life outcomes align with established research
- **Sound theoretical framework**: The mathematical explanation connecting R-squared to the cosine of angles between vectors is conceptually correct

### Practical Relevance
- **EA applications**: Thoughtfully connects statistical concepts to effective altruism decision-making
- **Broader implications**: Highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in prediction and evaluation

## Weaknesses

### Outdated References
- Several key citations date from 2008-2014, potentially missing recent developments in the field
- IQ correlation studies referenced are over a decade old

### Mathematical Presentation
- Mathematical rigor is admittedly lacking in places
- Notation inconsistencies ("+4SD" vs "4SD") could confuse readers
- The geometric explanation, while intuitive, could benefit from more formal treatment

### Unverifiable Claims
- Bill Gates' "+4SD intelligence" is speculative without documented evidence
- Some assertions use qualifying language ("I'd guess," "I'd intuit") that weakens confidence

### Technical Issues
- External image hosting may lead to broken links over time
- R-squared of 0.5 described as "remarkably strong" is slight overstatement (more accurately "strong" or "substantial")

## Recommendations

1. **Update references**: Replace 2008-2014 citations with more recent research to strengthen empirical support
2. **Enhance mathematical rigor**: Provide formal proofs or more detailed mathematical explanations for readers seeking deeper understanding
3. **Clarify speculation**: More clearly distinguish between verified facts and educated estimates
4. **Improve accessibility**: Consider adding interactive visualizations to illustrate the geometric concepts
5. **Expand practical applications**: Include examples beyond EA to broaden appeal and utility

## Key Highlights

- **Central insight**: Even strong correlations (R² = 0.5) result in significant tail divergence—a +4SD predictor yields only +2SD outcome
- **Multifactor causation**: Elegantly demonstrates why single predictors rarely explain extreme outcomes
- **Methodological caution**: Important reminder for EA and other fields focused on identifying "the best" interventions—regression to the mean is inevitable
- **Statistical literacy**: Contributes to public understanding of correlation vs. causation and the limitations of predictive models

## Overall Assessment

This article succeeds in explaining an important statistical concept that has broad implications for decision-making in various fields. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in updating references and enhancing mathematical rigor, the piece effectively communicates its core message through clear writing and well-chosen examples. The honest acknowledgment of limitations adds credibility, and the practical applications make it valuable for audiences beyond statistics enthusiasts.
