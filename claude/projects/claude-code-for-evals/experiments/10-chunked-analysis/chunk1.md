# Why the tails fall apart

[I'm unsure how much this rehashes things 'everyone knows already' - if old hat, feel free to downvote into oblivion. My other motivation for the [cross-post](http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/2014/07/tails-come-apart/) is the hope it might catch the interest of someone with a stronger mathematical background who could make this line of argument more robust]

[Edit 2014/11/14: mainly adjustments and rewording in light of the many helpful comments below (thanks!). I've also added a geometric explanation.]

Many outcomes of interest have pretty good predictors. It seems that height correlates to performance in basketball (the average height in the NBA is around [6'7"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_league_average_height,_weight,_age_and_playing_experience)). Faster serves in tennis improve one's likelihood of winning. IQ scores are known to predict a slew of factors, from [income](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/02/06/correlations-of-iq-with-income-and-wealth/), to chance of [being imprisoned](http://www.sagepub.com/schram/study/materials/reference/90851_04.2r.pdf), to[ lifespan](http://www.bmj.com/content/322/7290/819).

What's interesting is what happens to these relationships 'out on the tail': extreme outliers of a given predictor are seldom similarly extreme outliers on the outcome it predicts, and vice versa. Although 6'7" is very tall, it lies within a [couple of standard deviations](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=male+height+distribution) of the median US adult male height - there are many thousands of US men taller than the average NBA player, yet are not in the NBA. Although elite tennis players have very fast serves, if you look at the players serving [the fastest serves ever recorded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_recorded_tennis_serves), they aren't the very best players of their time. It is harder to look at the IQ case due to test ceilings, but again there seems to be some divergence near the top: the very highest earners tend[ to be very smart](http://infoproc.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich.html), but their intelligence is not in step with their income (their cognitive ability is around +3 to +4 SD above the mean, yet their wealth is much higher than this) (1).

The trend seems to be that even when two factors are correlated, their tails diverge: the fastest servers are good tennis players, but not the very best (and the very best players serve fast, but not the very fastest); the very richest tend to be smart, but not the very smartest (and vice versa). Why?

# Too much of a good thing?

One candidate explanation would be that more isn't always better, and the correlations one gets looking at the whole population doesn't capture a reversal at the right tail. Maybe being taller at basketball is good *up to a point*, but being really tall leads to greater costs in terms of things like agility. Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing too heavily on one's serve counterproductively neglects other areas of one's game. Maybe a high IQ is good for earning money, but a stratospherically high IQ [has an increased risk of productivity-reducing mental illness](http://prometheussociety.org/cms/articles/the-outsiders). Or something along those lines.

I would guess that these sorts of 'hidden trade-offs' are common. But, the 'divergence of tails' seems pretty ubiquitous (the tallest aren't the heaviest, the smartest parents don't have the smartest children, the fastest runners aren't the best footballers, etc. etc.), and it would be weird if there was always a 'too much of a good thing' story to be told for all of these associations. I think there is a more general explanation.
