# Chunk 3 Analysis

Time: 8001ms

Here are the issues I found in chunk 3:

Factual/Mathematical:
1. In the paragraph about +4SD and +3SD intelligence, there appears to be an error in the population estimates. The numbers given (10 at +4SD, 500 at +3SD) don't match standard normal distribution ratios.

Grammar/Typos:
1. "Move down the tail to less extremely smart people - +3SD say." - Awkward phrasing and missing comma after "say"
2. "ceteris paribus" should be italicized for consistency with other Latin terms
3. In "so the average wealth of the +4SD intelligence population is 1SD higher than the 3SD intelligence people" - missing "+" before "3SD"

Unclear Reasoning:
1. The transition between the intuitive explanation and the geometric explanation is abrupt and could use a better connecting statement
2. The toy model assumes intelligence and conscientiousness are "equally important" but doesn't specify how this equality is measured

Technical Note:
The image references in the text ("t3_km6_0.png" and "t3_km6_1.png") appear to be formatted for a specific platform and might not be universally accessible.
