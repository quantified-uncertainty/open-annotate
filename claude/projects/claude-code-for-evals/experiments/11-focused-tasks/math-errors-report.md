## Findings

I'll analyze this blog post for mathematical, statistical, and logical errors:

1. Error Quote: "the R-square measure of correlation between two sets of data is the same as the cosine of the angle between them"
Error: This is incorrect. The correlation coefficient (r) is equal to the cosine of the angle, not R-squared. R-squared (r²) would be the square of the cosine.
Correction: "The correlation coefficient (r) between two sets of data is equal to the cosine of the angle between them when presented as vectors in N-dimensional space."

2. Error Quote: "an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of sixty degrees)"
Error: This is mathematically incorrect. If R² = 0.5, then r = √0.5 ≈ 0.707, which corresponds to an angle of approximately 45 degrees (cos⁻¹(0.707)), not 60 degrees.
Correction: "an R-square of 0.5 (corresponding to an angle of approximately 45 degrees)"

3. Error Quote: "+4SD (~1/15000) on a factor will be expected to be 'merely' +2SD (~1/40) in the outcome"
Error: The probability of being more than 2 standard deviations from the mean is approximately 1/44 (2.3%), not 1/40. The probability of being more than 4 standard deviations from the mean is approximately 1/15,873, not 1/15,000.
Correction: "+4SD (~1/15,873) on a factor will be expected to be 'merely' +2SD (~1/44) in the outcome"

4. Logical Error in: "...and a R-square of 0.5 is remarkably strong in the social sciences, implying it accounts for half the variance."
While technically correct that R² = 0.5 means 50% of variance is explained, the statement presents a potential logical fallacy by implying that this level of correlation is "remarkably strong" without proper context or comparison to typical correlation values in social sciences.

These errors don't significantly impact the main thesis of the article, but they do represent important technical inaccuracies in the mathematical presentation.
