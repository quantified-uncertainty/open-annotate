## Findings

Here are the key contradictions and inconsistencies I found in the blog post:

1. Contradiction between mathematical precision and uncertainty
Quote 1: "For a toy model, pretend that wealth is wholly explained by two factors: intelligence and conscientiousness. Let's also say these are equally important to the outcome, independent of one another and are normally distributed."
Quote 2: "My intuition is that in cartesian coordinates the R-square between correlated X and Y is actually also the cosine of the angle between the regression lines of X on Y and Y on X. But I can't see an obvious derivation, and I'm too lazy to demonstrate it myself."
The author switches between precise mathematical models and admitted uncertainty/intuition without clearly delineating which parts are proven versus speculative.

2. Inconsistent treatment of sample sizes
Quote 1: "Providing the sample size is largeish, and the correlation not too tight (the tighter the correlation, the larger the sample size required), one will observe the ellipses with the bulging sides of the distribution."
Quote 2: "Move down the tail to less extremely smart people - +3SD say. These people don't get such a boost to their wealth from their intelligence, but there should be a lot more of them (if 10 at +4SD, around 500 at +3SD)"
The post fluctuates between requiring large samples for the theory to work and using very small sample sizes in examples without addressing this potential contradiction.

3. Unclear causal relationship claims
Quote: "Although being tall matters for being good at basketball, strength, agility, hand-eye-coordination matter as well (to name but a few)."
The post sometimes implies direct causation between correlated factors while elsewhere maintaining they are merely correlated, creating ambiguity about the nature of these relationships.

4. Inconsistent conclusions about practical applications
Quote 1: "This probably has limited practical relevance."
Quote 2: "There may be spread betting or portfolio scenarios where this factor comes into play"
The post contradicts itself about whether the findings have practical applications, first dismissing their relevance then suggesting specific applications.

These inconsistencies affect the argument's validity by making it unclear which parts of the analysis are meant to be taken as rigorous mathematical proofs versus general observations or intuitions. This makes it difficult to evaluate the strength of the overall argument and its practical implications.
