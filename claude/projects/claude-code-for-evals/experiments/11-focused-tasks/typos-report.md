## Findings

Here are the typos, grammar errors, and formatting issues I found:

1. "crossing crossing the plate" - Repeated word
Correction: "crossing the plate"

2. "Here's one I grabbed off google" - "Google" should be capitalized
Correction: "Here's one I grabbed off Google"

3. "convenience sampled from googling" - "googling" should be capitalized
Correction: "convenience sampled from Googling"

4. "of this:" followed by an image but no subject specified - Incomplete sentence
Correction: Remove "of this:" or add a subject

5. "Providing the sample size is largeish" - Non-standard word usage
Correction: "Provided the sample size is fairly large"

6. "Although a +4SD intelligence person will likely be better than a given +3SD intelligence person (the mean conscientiousness in both populations is 0SD, and so the average wealth of the +4SD intelligence population is 1SD higher than the 3SD intelligence people)" - Missing article before "3SD"
Correction: "...higher than the +3SD intelligence people"

7. "Mainly adjustments and rewording" - Missing verb
Correction: "Mainly made adjustments and rewording"

8. "But it has relevance to Effective Altruism, given it generally focuses" - Awkward construction
Correction: "But it has relevance to Effective Altruism, which generally focuses"

9. Inconsistent spacing after periods throughout the text - Some have single spaces, others have double spaces

10. Inconsistent capitalization of "SD" vs "sd" when referring to standard deviations

The text otherwise appears to be grammatically sound, though there are some stylistic choices that, while not strictly incorrect, could be made more consistent.
