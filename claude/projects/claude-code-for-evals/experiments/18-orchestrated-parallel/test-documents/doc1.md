  "## Summary
  This model estimates how a $5,000 annual Universal Basic Income (UBI) would affect labor supply in the US. The analysis considers income effects, substitution effects, and demographic factors.

  ## Key Findings",
  {
    percentChange: impact.percentChange,
    totalHourChange: impact.totalHourChange,
    gdpImpact: impact.gdpImpact,
  },
  "## Major Assumptions & Uncertainties
  - Income effects are based on empirical studies of lottery winners and inheritance recipients, which may not perfectly translate to UBI
  - The model assumes uniform effects across demographics, but responses likely vary by:
    - Income level (poorer workers may reduce hours more)
    - Age (older workers may be more likely to retire)
    - Industry (knowledge workers vs service workers)
    - Family status (single parents vs dual income households)
  - Key uncertainties not modeled:
    - General equilibrium effects on wages
    - Changes in entrepreneurship rates
    - Impact on informal work and volunteering
    - Long-term cultural shifts in work attitudes

  ## Detailed Analysis
  The model suggests a labor supply reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.percentChange), ".1f") +
    "%** (90% CI: " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.05), ".1f") +
    "% to " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.95), ".1f") +
    "%)",
  "This represents an annual reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.totalHourChange) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** work hours, with an estimated GDP impact of **$" +
    String(mean(impact.gdpImpact) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** per year.

  ## Important Caveats
  - Results are highly sensitive to assumptions about income elasticity
  - The model doesn't capture potential productivity gains from reduced financial stress
  - Geographic variations in cost of living would affect impact
  - Administrative costs and funding mechanisms not considered",
