üé≠ ORCHESTRATED PARALLEL ANALYSIS
================================
Document: test-web-search.md

üìä Phase 1: Analyzing document characteristics with LLM...
   Running LLM-based document classification...
   Document type detected: empirical_research
   Flaw density: high
   Analysis depth: comprehensive
   Features: empirical_claims
   Reasoning: Document consists entirely of empirical claims presented as facts. Contains multiple factual errors (Python created in 1991 not 1995, Amazon founded in 1994 not 1992) requiring thorough fact-checking and source verification.

üìã Phase 2: Generating task list...
   Generated 3 analysis tasks

‚úçÔ∏è  Phase 3: Creating task prompts...
Created 3 prompts in outputs/test-web-search-20250710-182604/prompts
   Created 3 prompts
