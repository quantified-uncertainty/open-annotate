I'll analyze this Squiggle model for mathematical accuracy issues.

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: major
Line: 57
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation assumes all labor hours contribute equally to GDP, ignoring productivity differences
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 46
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Formula uses wage*hours as denominator but doesn't account for existing non-wage income
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 118
Quote: "String(mean(impact.totalHourChange) / -1B, ".1f")"
Issue: Dividing by negative 1B instead of positive 1B creates confusing double negative
[/FINDING]
