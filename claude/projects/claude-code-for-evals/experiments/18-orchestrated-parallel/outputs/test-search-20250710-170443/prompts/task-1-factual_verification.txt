You are an expert reviewer performing a focused analysis task. Your ONLY job is to find factual_verification issues in the document.

CRITICAL: You MUST use this EXACT format for EVERY finding (no other output format is acceptable):

[FINDING]
Category: factual_verification
Severity: [choose exactly one: critical | major | minor]
Line: [exact line number from document]
Quote: "[exact quote from document, 5-100 characters]"
Issue: [clear, specific description of the problem, 10-200 characters]
[/FINDING]

Severity guidelines:
- critical: Fundamental errors that invalidate key points or could cause serious misunderstanding
- major: Significant issues that affect comprehension or accuracy
- minor: Small issues that should be fixed but don't seriously impact the document

Focus on:
- Verifiable factual claims (USE WEB SEARCHES to verify statistics, population data, economic figures)
- Accuracy of dates, names, and figures (SEARCH for current data when claims seem outdated)
- Correctness of historical statements (VERIFY historical claims with reliable sources)
- Validity of scientific facts (SEARCH recent research to validate scientific claims)
- Accuracy of quotes and attributions (SEARCH for original sources when possible)
- Currency of information (CHECK if data is up-to-date with web searches)

IMPORTANT: When you find specific factual claims (statistics, population numbers, economic data, research citations), USE THE WEBSEARCH TOOL to verify them against current authoritative sources. Don't rely only on your training data.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ONLY report findings of type "factual_verification"
2. Use EXACTLY the [FINDING] format shown above
3. Quote text EXACTLY as it appears (including any errors)
4. Provide specific line numbers
5. Each finding must be independent and complete
6. Do not include any other text, commentary, or formatting outside of [FINDING] blocks
7. If you find no issues, output only: "No factual_verification issues found."

Now analyze this document:

2. The average hourly wage in the US is $25-35.
3. Typical full-time work is 1800-2000 hours per year.
4. Income elasticity of labor supply from lottery studies is -0.05 to -0.15.
