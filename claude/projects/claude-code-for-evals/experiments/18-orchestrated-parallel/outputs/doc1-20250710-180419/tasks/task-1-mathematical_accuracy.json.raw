I'll analyze this Squiggle model for mathematical accuracy issues.

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: major
Line: 47
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Formula treats elasticity as if UBI is a percentage of annual income, but elasticity typically measures response to percentage changes in income
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 52
Quote: "totalEffect = incomeEffect + inputs.substitutionEffect"
Issue: Adding elasticities directly is mathematically questionable - effects should be multiplicative or use proper economic formula
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: major
Line: 60
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation oversimplified - ignores marginal product of labor, multiplier effects, and that GDP != wage bill
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 34
Quote: "incomeElasticity = normal({ p5: -0.15, p95: -0.05 })"
Issue: Normal distribution with only percentiles specified may not accurately represent the uncertainty in elasticity estimates
[/FINDING]
