Issue: Using 5th and 95th percentiles to construct confidence interval without verifying distribution assumptions

Quote: "incomeElasticity = normal({ p5: -0.15, p95: -0.05 })"
Issue: Assumes normal distribution for elasticity parameter without justification from empirical studies

Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation oversimplified - doesn't account for multiplier effects or economic complexity

Line: 45
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Linear elasticity application may not hold for large income changes or across income distributions

Severity: critical
Line: 82
Quote: "The model assumes uniform effects across demographics"
Issue: Assuming uniform effects invalidates results - labor supply elasticity varies significantly by income level
