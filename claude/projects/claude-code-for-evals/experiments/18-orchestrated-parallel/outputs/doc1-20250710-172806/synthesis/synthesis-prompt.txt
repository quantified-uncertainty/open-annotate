  This model estimates how a $5,000 annual Universal Basic Income (UBI) would affect labor supply in the US. The analysis considers income effects, substitution effects, and demographic factors.

  "## Major Assumptions & Uncertainties
  - Income effects are based on empirical studies of lottery winners and inheritance recipients, which may not perfectly translate to UBI
  - The model assumes uniform effects across demographics, but responses likely vary by:
    - Income level (poorer workers may reduce hours more)
    - Age (older workers may be more likely to retire)
    - Industry (knowledge workers vs service workers)
    - Family status (single parents vs dual income households)
  - Key uncertainties not modeled:
    - General equilibrium effects on wages
    - Changes in entrepreneurship rates
    - Impact on informal work and volunteering
    - Long-term cultural shifts in work attitudes

  ## Detailed Analysis
  The model suggests a labor supply reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.percentChange), ".1f") +
    "%** (90% CI: " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.05), ".1f") +
    "% to " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.95), ".1f") +
    "%)",
  "This represents an annual reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.totalHourChange) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** work hours, with an estimated GDP impact of **$" +
    String(mean(impact.gdpImpact) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** per year.

  ## Important Caveats
  - Results are highly sensitive to assumptions about income elasticity
  - The model doesn't capture potential productivity gains from reduced financial stress
  - Geographic variations in cost of living would affect impact
  - Administrative costs and funding mechanisms not considered",

## Validated Findings (21 total)

Critical Issues (1):
- Line 60: Taking mean of wage after multiplication ignores correlation structure and may underestimate uncertainty (statistical_validity)

Major Issues (10):
- Line 32: Extrapolating from lottery/inheritance studies to UBI may not be statistically valid due to different behavioral contexts (statistical_validity)
- Line 33: BLS data shows $36.30/hour average (June 2025), base range underestimates current wages (factual_verification)
- Line 35: Using normal distribution for bounded elasticity parameter may produce invalid values outside economic bounds (statistical_validity)
- Line 40: Normal distribution for substitution effect could yield positive values contradicting the stated negative effect (statistical_validity)
- Line 41: Income elasticity defined as negative, but substitution effect also negative - typically opposite signs (logical_consistency)
- Line 58: Formula multiplies negative elasticity by positive ratio, but comment says this reduces labor supply (logical_consistency)
- Line 73: GDP impact calculation missing annual hours multiplier - should be hourly wage × hours × workers (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 99: Model assumes uniform effects despite acknowledging heterogeneous responses, potentially biasing estimates (statistical_validity)
- Line 111: Contradicts economic theory - poorer workers typically have less elastic labor supply (logical_consistency)
- Line 134: Claims to not capture productivity but uses fixed wage rates which assumes no productivity change (logical_consistency)

Minor Issues (10):
- Line 24: Mixture weights (0.9, 0.1) lack justification for wage distribution (statistical_validity)
- Line 26: Current data shows 211.78M (May 2025), range accurate but could be more precise (factual_verification)
- Line 30: Mixture weights (0.9, 0.1) for work hours lack empirical basis (statistical_validity)
- Line 67: Effects are additive but may interact multiplicatively in reality (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 68: Comment mentions correcting calculation but doesn't explain what was wrong before (logical_consistency)
- Line 70: Should multiply by labor force participation rate, not total working age population (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 78: Test expects negative range but doesn't validate that totalEffect calculation produces negative values (logical_consistency)
- Line 86: Test bounds seem arbitrary without justification for these specific ranges (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 114: Confidence interval interpretation unclear given mixture of uncertainty sources (population, parameters, model) (statistical_validity)
- Line 127: No factual error but model dated Sun Jul 06 2025 uses July 2025 data inconsistently (factual_verification)
