I'll analyze this Squiggle model for logical consistency issues.

Severity: major
Line: 41
Quote: "incomeElasticity = normal({ p5: -0.15, p95: -0.05 })"
Issue: Income elasticity defined as negative, but substitution effect also negative - typically opposite signs
[/FINDING]

Category: logical_consistency
Severity: major
Line: 58
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity *"
Issue: Formula multiplies negative elasticity by positive ratio, but comment says this reduces labor supply
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: logical_consistency
Severity: minor
Line: 68
Quote: "// Correct wage impact calculation by taking mean wage"
Issue: Comment mentions correcting calculation but doesn't explain what was wrong before
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: logical_consistency
Severity: major
Line: 111
Quote: "poorer workers may reduce hours more"
Issue: Contradicts economic theory - poorer workers typically have less elastic labor supply
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: logical_consistency
Severity: minor
Line: 78
Quote: "sTest.expect(mean(impact.percentChange)).toBeBetween(-8, -1)"
Issue: Test expects negative range but doesn't validate that totalEffect calculation produces negative values
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: logical_consistency
Severity: major
Line: 134
Quote: "model doesn't capture potential productivity gains"
Issue: Claims to not capture productivity but uses fixed wage rates which assumes no productivity change
[/FINDING]
