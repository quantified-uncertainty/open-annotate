I'll analyze this Squiggle model for mathematical accuracy issues.

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 70
Quote: "totalHourChange = hourChangePerWorker * inputs.workingAgePop"
Issue: Should multiply by labor force participation rate, not total working age population
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: major
Line: 73
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation missing annual hours multiplier - should be hourly wage × hours × workers
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 64
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Income elasticity formula assumes linear relationship which may not hold for large income changes
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 67
Quote: "totalEffect = incomeEffect + inputs.substitutionEffect"
Issue: Effects are additive but may interact multiplicatively in reality
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 86
Quote: "sTest.expect(mean(impact.totalHourChange)).toBeBetween(-20B, -5B)"
Issue: Test bounds seem arbitrary without justification for these specific ranges
[/FINDING]
