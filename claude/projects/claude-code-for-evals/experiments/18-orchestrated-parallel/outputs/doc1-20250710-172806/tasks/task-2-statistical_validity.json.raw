Quote: "Based on empirical studies of lottery winners and inheritance recipients."
Issue: Extrapolating from lottery/inheritance studies to UBI may not be statistically valid due to different behavioral contexts

Quote: "mx([25 to 35, 15 to 100], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: Mixture weights (0.9, 0.1) lack justification for wage distribution

Quote: "mx([1800 to 2000, 1000 to 2500], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: Mixture weights (0.9, 0.1) for work hours lack empirical basis

Quote: "normal({ p5: -0.15, p95: -0.05 })"
Issue: Using normal distribution for bounded elasticity parameter may produce invalid values outside economic bounds
[/FINDING]

Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 40
Quote: "normal({ p5: -0.1, p95: 0 })"
Issue: Normal distribution for substitution effect could yield positive values contradicting the stated negative effect
[/FINDING]

Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: Taking mean of wage after multiplication ignores correlation structure and may underestimate uncertainty
[/FINDING]

Quote: "responses likely vary by:\n    - Income level (poorer workers may reduce hours more)"
Issue: Model assumes uniform effects despite acknowledging heterogeneous responses, potentially biasing estimates
[/FINDING]

Severity: minor
Line: 114
Quote: "90% CI: " + String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.05), ".1f")"
Issue: Confidence interval interpretation unclear given mixture of uncertainty sources (population, parameters, model)
[/FINDING]
