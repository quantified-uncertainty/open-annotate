Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Missing parentheses may cause order of operations confusion; elasticity formula should be clearer

Quote: "totalEffect = incomeEffect + inputs.substitutionEffect"
Issue: Adding elasticities directly is incorrect; effects should be multiplicative (1 + effect1) * (1 + effect2) - 1

Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation oversimplified; ignores multiplier effects and assumes hourly wage equals marginal product
