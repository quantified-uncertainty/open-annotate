I'll analyze this document for logical consistency issues.

Quote: "Negative as higher non-wage income reduces labor supply"
Issue: Contradicts line 68 - if elasticity is negative and UBI is positive income, the multiplication should increase hours worked, not decrease
[/FINDING]

Severity: major
Line: 68
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Mathematical inconsistency - negative elasticity multiplied by positive ratio should give negative effect, but this is treated as hours reduction
[/FINDING]

Category: logical_consistency
Severity: minor
Line: 99
Quote: "percent change is negative but modest"
Issue: Test expects negative values but the calculation logic would produce positive values given negative elasticity
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: logical_consistency
Severity: critical
Line: 131
Quote: "The model suggests a labor supply reduction"
Issue: Fundamental contradiction - the math shows negative elasticity Ã— positive income ratio = negative effect, which means hours increase, not decrease
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: logical_consistency
Severity: major
Line: 144
Quote: "Results are highly sensitive to assumptions about income elasticity"
Issue: Claims sensitivity to elasticity but uses fixed negative range (-0.15 to -0.05) with no exploration of positive values
[/FINDING]
