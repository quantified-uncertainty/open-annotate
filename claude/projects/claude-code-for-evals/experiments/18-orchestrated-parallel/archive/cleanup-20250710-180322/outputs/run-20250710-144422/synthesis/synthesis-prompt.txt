  This model estimates how a $5,000 annual Universal Basic Income (UBI) would affect labor supply in the US. The analysis considers income effects, substitution effects, and demographic factors.

  "## Major Assumptions & Uncertainties
  - Income effects are based on empirical studies of lottery winners and inheritance recipients, which may not perfectly translate to UBI
  - The model assumes uniform effects across demographics, but responses likely vary by:
    - Income level (poorer workers may reduce hours more)
    - Age (older workers may be more likely to retire)
    - Industry (knowledge workers vs service workers)
    - Family status (single parents vs dual income households)
  - Key uncertainties not modeled:
    - General equilibrium effects on wages
    - Changes in entrepreneurship rates
    - Impact on informal work and volunteering
    - Long-term cultural shifts in work attitudes

  ## Detailed Analysis
  The model suggests a labor supply reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.percentChange), ".1f") +
    "%** (90% CI: " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.05), ".1f") +
    "% to " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.95), ".1f") +
    "%)",
  "This represents an annual reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.totalHourChange) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** work hours, with an estimated GDP impact of **$" +
    String(mean(impact.gdpImpact) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** per year.

  ## Important Caveats
  - Results are highly sensitive to assumptions about income elasticity
  - The model doesn't capture potential productivity gains from reduced financial stress
  - Geographic variations in cost of living would affect impact
  - Administrative costs and funding mechanisms not considered",

## Validated Findings (26 total)

Critical Issues (1):
- Line 75: GDP impact calculation oversimplified - ignores multiplier effects and productivity differences (statistical_validity)

Major Issues (8):
- Line 32: Mixture distribution for wages lacks justification for 90/10 split between ranges (statistical_validity)
- Line 42: No basis provided for 90/10 probability weights in work hours distribution (statistical_validity)
- Line 50: Normal distribution may not be appropriate for bounded elasticity parameter (statistical_validity)
- Line 62: No validation for potential division by zero if baseWorkHours is 0 (code_quality)
- Line 70: GDP impact calculation is oversimplified - doesn't account for productivity multipliers or economic value-add beyond wages (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 91: Vague statement without explaining key differences between lottery/inheritance and UBI (clarity_readability)
- Line 109: External validity concern - lottery/inheritance studies may not generalize to UBI (statistical_validity)
- Line 113: Acknowledges but doesn't address critical heterogeneity in treatment effects (statistical_validity)

Minor Issues (17):
- Line 24: Missing article "the" before "service sector" (spelling_grammar)
- Line 39: Missing context about why lottery/inheritance studies relate to UBI effects (clarity_readability)
- Line 46: Missing subject; sentence fragment needs "Some workers" or similar (spelling_grammar)
- Line 73: Inconsistent uncertainty handling - other calculations preserve distributions (code_quality)
- Line 79: Ambiguous wording - unclear if "negative" means reduction or value below zero (clarity_readability)
- Line 85: Magic numbers without explanation or named constants (code_quality)
- Line 90: Magic numbers without explanation or named constants (code_quality)
- Line 99: Economic jargon without explanation for general audience (clarity_readability)
- Line 107: Presenting mean of percentage changes without accounting for population distribution weights (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 115: Repeated string formatting pattern could be extracted to helper function (code_quality)
- Line 122: Should be "reduce hours more significantly" or "work fewer hours" (spelling_grammar)
- Line 122: Unclear negative division operation - should use abs() or clearer logic (code_quality)
- Line 124: Missing periods after "vs" abbreviation (spelling_grammar)
- Line 125: Missing periods after "vs" abbreviation (spelling_grammar)
- Line 125: Unclear how cost of living affects labor supply impact (clarity_readability)
- Line 125: Unclear negative division operation - should use abs() or clearer logic (code_quality)
- Line 127: Should specify this is a credible interval from simulation, not confidence interval (statistical_validity)
