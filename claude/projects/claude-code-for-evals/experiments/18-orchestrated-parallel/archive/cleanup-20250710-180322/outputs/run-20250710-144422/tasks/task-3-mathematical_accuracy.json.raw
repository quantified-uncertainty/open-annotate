Looking through this Squiggle model for mathematical accuracy issues:

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: major
Line: 70
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation is oversimplified - doesn't account for productivity multipliers or economic value-add beyond wages
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 61
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Formula assumes linear elasticity response which may not hold for large income changes
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 107
Quote: "labor supply reduction of **" + String(mean(impact.percentChange), ".1f")"
Issue: Presenting mean of percentage changes without accounting for population distribution weights
[/FINDING]
