  This model estimates how a $5,000 annual Universal Basic Income (UBI) would affect labor supply in the US. The analysis considers income effects, substitution effects, and demographic factors.

  "## Major Assumptions & Uncertainties
  - Income effects are based on empirical studies of lottery winners and inheritance recipients, which may not perfectly translate to UBI
  - The model assumes uniform effects across demographics, but responses likely vary by:
    - Income level (poorer workers may reduce hours more)
    - Age (older workers may be more likely to retire)
    - Industry (knowledge workers vs service workers)
    - Family status (single parents vs dual income households)
  - Key uncertainties not modeled:
    - General equilibrium effects on wages
    - Changes in entrepreneurship rates
    - Impact on informal work and volunteering
    - Long-term cultural shifts in work attitudes

  ## Detailed Analysis
  The model suggests a labor supply reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.percentChange), ".1f") +
    "%** (90% CI: " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.05), ".1f") +
    "% to " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.95), ".1f") +
    "%)",
  "This represents an annual reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.totalHourChange) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** work hours, with an estimated GDP impact of **$" +
    String(mean(impact.gdpImpact) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** per year.

  ## Important Caveats
  - Results are highly sensitive to assumptions about income elasticity
  - The model doesn't capture potential productivity gains from reduced financial stress
  - Geographic variations in cost of living would affect impact
  - Administrative costs and funding mechanisms not considered",

## Validated Findings (20 total)

Critical Issues (2):
- Line 98: Model calculates GDP impact from hours reduction but admits it ignores productivity changes (logical_consistency)
- Line 119: Confidence interval interpretation unclear - mixing uncertainty from different sources (statistical_validity)

Major Issues (8):
- Line 32: Mixing distributions without clear justification for 90/10 split in wage distribution (statistical_validity)
- Line 38: Substitution effect defined as reducing hours for means-testing but UBI is universal, not means-tested (logical_consistency)
- Line 40: Arbitrary 90/10 probability weights for work hours distribution lack empirical basis (statistical_validity)
- Line 70: Oversimplified GDP calculation ignores multiplier effects and economic complexity (statistical_validity)
- Line 73: GDP impact calculation assumes all work hours contribute equally to GDP regardless of productivity (logical_consistency)
- Line 86: Model assumes lottery/inheritance elasticities apply to regular UBI payments without justification (logical_consistency)
- Line 89: GDP impact calculation assumes all work hours contribute equally to GDP regardless of productivity differences (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 105: External validity concern - lottery winner behavior may not generalize to UBI recipients (statistical_validity)

Minor Issues (10):
- Line 22: Definition uses ages 15-64, but US typically defines working age as 16-64 (factual_verification)
- Line 23: Age 15 is below US working age; should be 16-64 (factual_verification)
- Line 24: US working age population (16-64) is approximately 205-210M as of 2024-2025 (factual_verification)
- Line 25: Wage distribution mixing assumes independence between wage levels and worker proportions (logical_consistency)
- Line 37: Full-time US work year is typically 2080 hours, not 1800-2000 (factual_verification)
- Line 40: Central range 1800-2000 underestimates typical full-time hours of 2080 (factual_verification)
- Line 47: Using normal distribution for bounded parameter (elasticity) without justification (statistical_validity)
- Line 64: Variable name conflicts - 'incomeEffect' used for both calculation result and model input (logical_consistency)
- Line 102: Test bounds don't align with calculation range given input distributions (mathematical_accuracy)
- Line 123: Presenting mean of percentage without noting distribution shape could be misleading for skewed results (mathematical_accuracy)
