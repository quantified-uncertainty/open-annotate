I'll analyze this Squiggle model for mathematical accuracy issues.

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: major
Line: 89
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation assumes all work hours contribute equally to GDP regardless of productivity differences
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 69
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Formula treats elasticity as applying to percentage of income rather than log income as typical in economics
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 102
Quote: "sTest.expect(mean(impact.totalHourChange)).toBeBetween(-20B, -5B)"
Issue: Test bounds don't align with calculation range given input distributions
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: mathematical_accuracy
Severity: minor
Line: 123
Quote: "The model suggests a labor supply reduction of **" + String(mean(impact.percentChange), ".1f")"
Issue: Presenting mean of percentage without noting distribution shape could be misleading for skewed results
[/FINDING]
