I've created a comprehensive editorial analysis report that synthesizes all 13 findings into a coherent narrative. The report includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Overall assessment highlighting that 7 major issues were found, primarily involving incorrect data and unverifiable claims

2. **Major Issues** - Detailed analysis of:
   - Unverifiable research claims (Harvard study, 2023 meta-analysis)
   - Incorrect economic data (unemployment rate, wage growth)
   - Missing statistical context

3. **Minor Issues** - Quick listing of outdated statistics and missing citations

4. **Positive Aspects** - Recognition of clear organization and appropriate scope

5. **Recommendations** - Three priority levels of improvements needed

6. **Technical Summary** - Statistical breakdown showing 54% major issues, 46% minor issues

The report maintains a professional tone while providing specific, actionable feedback for improving the document's accuracy and citation practices.
