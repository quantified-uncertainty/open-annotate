  This model estimates how a $5,000 annual Universal Basic Income (UBI) would affect labor supply in the US. The analysis considers income effects, substitution effects, and demographic factors.

    totalHourChange: impact.totalHourChange,

  "## Major Assumptions & Uncertainties
  - Income effects are based on empirical studies of lottery winners and inheritance recipients, which may not perfectly translate to UBI
  - The model assumes uniform effects across demographics, but responses likely vary by:
    - Income level (poorer workers may reduce hours more)
    - Age (older workers may be more likely to retire)
    - Industry (knowledge workers vs service workers)
    - Family status (single parents vs dual income households)
  - Key uncertainties not modeled:
    - General equilibrium effects on wages
    - Changes in entrepreneurship rates
    - Impact on informal work and volunteering
    - Long-term cultural shifts in work attitudes

  ## Detailed Analysis
  The model suggests a labor supply reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.percentChange), ".1f") +
    "%** (90% CI: " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.05), ".1f") +
    "% to " +
    String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.95), ".1f") +
    "%)",
  "This represents an annual reduction of **" +
    String(mean(impact.totalHourChange) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** work hours, with an estimated GDP impact of **$" +
    String(mean(impact.gdpImpact) / -1B, ".1f") +
    "B** per year.

  ## Important Caveats
  - Results are highly sensitive to assumptions about income elasticity
  - The model doesn't capture potential productivity gains from reduced financial stress
  - Geographic variations in cost of living would affect impact
  - Administrative costs and funding mechanisms not considered",

## Validated Findings (4 total)

Critical Issues (1):
- Line 131: Fundamental contradiction - the math shows negative elasticity Ã— positive income ratio = negative effect, which means hours increase, not decrease (logical_consistency)

Major Issues (2):
- Line 52: Contradicts line 68 - if elasticity is negative and UBI is positive income, the multiplication should increase hours worked, not decrease (logical_consistency)
- Line 144: Claims sensitivity to elasticity but uses fixed negative range (-0.15 to -0.05) with no exploration of positive values (logical_consistency)

Minor Issues (1):
- Line 99: Test expects negative values but the calculation logic would produce positive values given negative elasticity (logical_consistency)
