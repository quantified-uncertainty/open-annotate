I'll analyze this document for statistical validity issues.

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 32
Quote: "mx([25 to 35, 15 to 100], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: Mixture distribution for wages lacks justification for 90/10 split between ranges
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 42
Quote: "mx([1800 to 2000, 1000 to 2500], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: No basis provided for 90/10 probability weights in work hours distribution
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 50
Quote: "normal({ p5: -0.15, p95: -0.05 })"
Issue: Normal distribution may not be appropriate for bounded elasticity parameter
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: critical
Line: 75
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: GDP impact calculation oversimplified - ignores multiplier effects and productivity differences
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 113
Quote: "The model assumes uniform effects across demographics"
Issue: Acknowledges but doesn't address critical heterogeneity in treatment effects
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 109
Quote: "Income effects are based on empirical studies of lottery winners"
Issue: External validity concern - lottery/inheritance studies may not generalize to UBI
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: minor
Line: 127
Quote: "90% CI"
Issue: Should specify this is a credible interval from simulation, not confidence interval
[/FINDING]
