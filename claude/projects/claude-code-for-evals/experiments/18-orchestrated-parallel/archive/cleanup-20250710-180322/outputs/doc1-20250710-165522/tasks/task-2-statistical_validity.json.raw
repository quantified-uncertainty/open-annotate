I'll analyze this document for statistical validity issues.

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 32
Quote: "mx([25 to 35, 15 to 100], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: Mixing distributions without clear justification for 90/10 split in wage distribution
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 40
Quote: "mx([1800 to 2000, 1000 to 2500], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: Arbitrary 90/10 probability weights for work hours distribution lack empirical basis
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: minor
Line: 47
Quote: "normal({ p5: -0.15, p95: -0.05 })"
Issue: Using normal distribution for bounded parameter (elasticity) without justification
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 70
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: Oversimplified GDP calculation ignores multiplier effects and economic complexity
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: critical
Line: 119
Quote: "90% CI: " + String(quantile(impact.percentChange, 0.05), ".1f")"
Issue: Confidence interval interpretation unclear - mixing uncertainty from different sources
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 105
Quote: "Income effects are based on empirical studies of lottery winners"
Issue: External validity concern - lottery winner behavior may not generalize to UBI recipients
[/FINDING]
