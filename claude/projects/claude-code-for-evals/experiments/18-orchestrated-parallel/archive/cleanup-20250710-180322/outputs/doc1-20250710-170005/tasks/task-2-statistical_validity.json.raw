I'll analyze this document for statistical validity issues.

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 31
Quote: "mx([25 to 35, 15 to 100], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: Mixture distribution with extreme range (15-100) that heavily skews results without justification
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 39
Quote: "mx([1800 to 2000, 1000 to 2500], [0.9, 0.1])"
Issue: Mixture includes implausible work hours (1000-2500 range) for typical US workers
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: critical
Line: 68
Quote: "incomeEffect = inputs.incomeElasticity * (inputs.ubiAmount / (inputs.avgWage * inputs.baseWorkHours))"
Issue: Invalid elasticity calculation - should use log changes for proper income elasticity formula
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 78
Quote: "gdpImpact = totalHourChange * mean(inputs.avgWage)"
Issue: Oversimplified GDP calculation ignores productivity differences and multiplier effects
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: minor
Line: 116
Quote: "90% CI:"
Issue: Confidence interval terminology incorrect for simulation output - should be "90% prediction interval"
[/FINDING]

[FINDING]
Category: statistical_validity
Severity: major
Line: 45
Quote: "Based on empirical studies of lottery winners and inheritance recipients"
Issue: External validity problem - lottery/inheritance elasticities may not apply to regular UBI payments
[/FINDING]
