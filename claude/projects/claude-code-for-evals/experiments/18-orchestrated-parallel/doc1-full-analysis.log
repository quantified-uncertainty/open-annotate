üé≠ ORCHESTRATED PARALLEL ANALYSIS
================================
Document: test-documents/doc1.md

üìä Phase 1: Analyzing document characteristics with LLM...
   Running LLM-based document classification...
   Document type detected: technical
   Flaw density: high
   Analysis depth: comprehensive
   Features: mathematical_content, code_content, empirical_claims, policy_recommendations
   Reasoning: This is a Squiggle probabilistic model analyzing UBI's impact on labor supply. It contains mathematical calculations, economic elasticity parameters, and empirical assumptions about labor markets. As a technical model with economic calculations and empirical claims, it requires comprehensive analysis for mathematical correctness, parameter validity, and logical consistency of the economic relationships modeled.

üìã Phase 2: Generating task list...
   Generated 4 analysis tasks

‚úçÔ∏è  Phase 3: Creating task prompts...
Created 4 prompts in outputs/doc1-20250710-182111/prompts
   Created 4 prompts
