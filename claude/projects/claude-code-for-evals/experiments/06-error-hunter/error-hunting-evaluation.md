# Error-Hunting Evaluation: Why the Tails Fall Apart

## Metadata
- Document: input.md
- Date: 2025-07-10
- Max Iterations: 6
- Goal: Find at least 10 specific, quotable errors or issues

## Error Hunting Tasks
□ Find typos and grammatical errors (quote exact text)
□ Verify all numerical claims with web search
□ Check mathematical statements for accuracy
□ Identify logical contradictions
□ Fact-check specific claims about people/organizations
□ Verify citations and references work
□ Find inconsistent terminology or notation
□ Identify unsupported factual assertions

## Current Focus
Starting with typos and grammatical errors scan...

## Errors Found

### Iteration 1: Typos and Grammatical Errors

1. **Line 7**: Space missing in "to[ lifespan]" - should be "to [lifespan]"
   - Exact quote: "to[ lifespan]"

2. **Line 15**: Grammar error - "Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but"
   - Should remove "although" or "but" to fix sentence structure
   - Exact quote: "Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing too heavily"

3. **Line 23**: Double word "crossing" - "compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate"
   - Exact quote: "compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate"

4. **Line 27**: Incomplete sentence fragment - "Look at this data (again convenience sampled from googling 'scatter plot') of this:"
   - The sentence ends with "of this:" but there's no completion
   - Exact quote: "Look at this data (again convenience sampled from googling 'scatter plot') of this:"

5. **Line 75**: Missing opening quotation mark - starts with single quote
   - Exact quote: "'Reading off the expected outcome"
   - Should be "'Reading off the expected outcome" or "Reading off the expected outcome"

6. **Line 87**: "richest man in america" - "america" should be capitalized
   - Exact quote: "despite being the richest man in america"

7. **Line 99**: Typo - "why you can by R-squared" should be "why you can multiply by R-squared"
   - Exact quote: "why you can by R-squared to move between z-scores"

8. **Line 83**: "(6)" footnote reference appears but footnote 6 is already used at line 75
   - This creates a duplicate footnote reference number
