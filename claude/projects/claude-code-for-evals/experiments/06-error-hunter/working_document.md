# Error-Hunting Evaluation: "Why the tails fall apart"

## Metadata
- **Document**: input.md
- **Title**: "Why the tails fall apart"
- **Type**: Blog post/essay on statistics and correlation
- **Focus**: Finding specific, concrete errors (not vague criticisms)
- **Max Iterations**: 6
- **Goal**: Find at least 10 specific, quotable errors or issues

## Error Hunting Tasks
□ Find typos and grammatical errors (quote exact text)
□ Verify all numerical claims with web search  
□ Check mathematical statements for accuracy
□ Identify logical contradictions
□ Fact-check specific claims about people/organizations
□ Verify citations and references work
□ Find inconsistent terminology or notation
□ Identify unsupported factual assertions

## Current Focus
Starting with typos and grammatical errors scan...

## Errors Found

### 1. Typo/Repetition (Line 23)
**Error**: "comparing the speed of a ball out of a baseball pitchers hand compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate"
**Issue**: Word "crossing" is repeated twice
**Quote**: "compared to its speed crossing crossing the plate"

### 2. Missing Apostrophe (Line 23)
**Error**: "baseball pitchers hand"
**Issue**: Should be "pitcher's hand" (possessive)
**Quote**: "a baseball pitchers hand"

### 3. Grammatical Error (Line 15)
**Error**: "Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing..."
**Issue**: Awkward construction with "Maybe although...but"
**Quote**: "Maybe although having a faster serve is better all things being equal, but focusing too heavily"

### 4. Missing Space (Line 7)
**Error**: "to[ lifespan]"
**Issue**: Missing space between "to" and link
**Quote**: "to[ lifespan]"

### 5. Incorrect Mathematical Statement (Line 75)
**Error**: "the inverse cosine equal the R-squared"
**Issue**: R-squared is the square of the correlation coefficient (R), not related to inverse cosine. The cosine of the angle equals R, not R-squared.
**Quote**: "the inverse cosine equal the R-squared"

### 6. Mathematical Error (Line 99)
**Error**: "you can by R-squared to move between z-scores"
**Issue**: Missing word "multiply" - should be "you can multiply by R-squared"
**Quote**: "you can by R-squared to move between z-scores"

### 7. Potential Numerical Error (Line 87)
**Error**: "richest man in america"
**Issue**: Bill Gates was not the richest man in America at time of writing (2014) - that would be Warren Buffett or someone else depending on exact date
**Quote**: "if Bill Gates is ~+4SD in intelligence, despite being the richest man in america"

### 8. Inconsistent Notation (Line 83)
**Error**: "(6)" used for footnote, but earlier uses "(1)", "(2)", etc. Then switches to "6\." format in footnote
**Issue**: Inconsistent footnote numbering system
**Quote**: "spread funds sooner.(6)" vs "6\. Another intuitive dividend"

### 9. Grammatical Error (Line 81)
**Error**: "someone who is 6'4".)"
**Issue**: Period inside quotes followed by period outside parenthesis
**Quote**: "someone who is 6'4".)"

### 10. Citation Format Error (Line 7)
**Error**: Wikipedia link format
**Issue**: The link uses old Wikipedia URL format that may not work correctly
**Quote**: "[6'7"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_league_average_height,_weight,_age_and_playing_experience)"

## Verification Results
- Need to verify NBA average height claim
- Need to check Bill Gates wealth ranking in 2014
- Need to verify mathematical relationships between R, R-squared, and trigonometric functions
- Need to check if referenced links are still active
