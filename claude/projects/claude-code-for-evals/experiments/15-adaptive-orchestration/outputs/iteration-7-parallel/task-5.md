## Analysis: Regression to the Mean and Correlation Degradation

Yes, the essay explicitly addresses regression to the mean and its relationship to correlation degradation. Here are the specific findings:

### Direct Mention of Regression to the Mean

**Line 49**: The essay directly mentions regression to the mean in the context of the graphical explanation:
> "If X and Y are 'Estimated effect size' and 'Actual effect size', or 'Performance at T', and 'Performance at T+n', then you have a graphical display of [winner's curse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner's_curse) and [regression to the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean)."

### Geometric Explanation of Regression to the Mean

**Lines 75**: The essay provides a geometric explanation that directly addresses regression to the mean:
> "As cos theta is never greater than 1, we see regression to the mean."

### Relationship to Correlation Degradation

The essay explains how correlation degradation at the extremes relates to regression to the mean through several mechanisms:

1. **Elliptical Distribution Pattern (Lines 39-47)**: The essay explains that correlated variables form elliptical distributions, and at the extremes, these ellipses have "bulges" where maximum values of one variable don't correspond to maximum values of the other.

2. **Multiple Factor Explanation (Lines 55-67)**: The essay demonstrates that when outcomes depend on multiple factors, extreme values in one factor will typically be accompanied by average values in other factors, leading to regression toward the mean in the outcome.

3. **Population Size Effect (Lines 59-61)**: Explains how smaller populations at extreme values reduce the likelihood of being extreme in multiple factors simultaneously:
   > "with 10 people at +4SD, you wouldn't expect any of them to be +2SD in conscientiousness"

### Practical Implications

**Lines 79-83**: The essay connects this to practical concerns about regression to the mean in Effective Altruism contexts:
> "It generally vindicates worries about regression to the mean or winner's curse, and suggests that these will be pretty insoluble in all cases where the populations are large"

The essay thoroughly addresses regression to the mean as a fundamental explanation for why extreme values in correlated variables don't maintain their extremity - what the author calls "why the tails come apart."
