# Cost Analysis: Iterative Document Evaluation

## Blog Post Stats
- **Length**: ~5,000 words / ~25,000 characters
- **Content**: Statistical/mathematical essay with formulas and examples

## Cost Breakdown (Without Optimization)

### Traditional Single Session Approach
From PR #58: $76 per million characters
- For 25k chars: **$1.90**
- Problem: Often gives up or loses context

### Iterative Approach (4-8 iterations)
Each iteration:
- Reads working doc (~2k chars growing to ~10k)
- Reads blog post (25k chars)
- 5-10 Claude turns
- Estimated 50k-100k tokens per iteration

Without caching:
- Per iteration: ~$0.15-0.30
- Total (6 iterations): **$0.90-1.80**

## With Prompt Caching

### How It Helps
1. Cache the blog post once (25k chars)
2. Each iteration only pays for:
   - Cache read (90% cheaper)
   - Working document changes
   - New prompts

### Optimized Costs
- Initial cache write: ~$0.05
- Per iteration: ~$0.01-0.02 (mostly cache reads)
- Total (6 iterations): **$0.10-0.15**

## Why Output Was Basic

The simulation I ran was just a demo - no actual LLM calls. With real Claude Code:

1. **Deeper Analysis Per Task**
   - Each iteration would use 5-10 turns
   - Would actually search for citations
   - Would verify mathematical claims
   - Would analyze writing style in detail

2. **Richer Working Memory**
   - Detailed notes on each claim
   - Links to verification sources
   - Specific examples of logical issues
   - Nuanced style critique

3. **Better Final Output**
   - More comprehensive highlights
   - Specific line-by-line feedback
   - Actionable improvement suggestions
   - Detailed scoring rubric

## Is It Worth It?

**Cost comparison:**
- Direct RoastMyPost eval: $0.02-0.05 (your current approach)
- Claude Code single session: $1.90 (too expensive, often fails)
- Iterative + caching: $0.10-0.15 (reliable, resumable)

**The iterative approach is ~2-3x more expensive than your current system**, but offers:
- Higher reliability (won't give up)
- Better depth (each task gets full attention)
- Resumability (can stop/start)
- Debugging (see thought process)

## Recommendation

The iterative pattern makes sense for:
1. High-value documents needing deep analysis
2. Testing/debugging new evaluation approaches
3. Cases where current system struggles

But for routine evaluations, your current approach is more cost-effective.
