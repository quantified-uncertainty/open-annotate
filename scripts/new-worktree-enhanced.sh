# new-worktree-enhanced.sh - Create a git worktree with full setup
#
# This enhanced version creates a new git worktree and:
# - Copies all .env files from the main repository
# - Runs npm install for both root and mcp-server
# - Generates Prisma client
# - Shows helpful next steps including port configuration
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/new-worktree-enhanced.sh <branch> [<commit-ish>]
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#   <branch>     - Name of the new branch to create (also used as worktree directory name)
#   <commit-ish> - Optional: base commit/branch (defaults to HEAD)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Create a new feature branch worktree based on current HEAD
#   ./scripts/new-worktree-enhanced.sh my-feature
#
#   # Create a fix branch based on main
#   ./scripts/new-worktree-enhanced.sh fix-issue-123 main
#
#   # Create an experimental branch based on develop
#   ./scripts/new-worktree-enhanced.sh experimental-feature develop
#
# TO REMOVE A WORKTREE:
#   git worktree remove ../[branch-name]
#   git branch -d [branch-name]  # to also delete the branch
