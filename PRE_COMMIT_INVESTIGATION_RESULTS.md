## Summary

Conducted a thorough pre-commit investigation of the API key authentication implementation. Found and fixed several issues:

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Console.log Statements in Production** ✅ FIXED
   - Removed 5 console.log/error statements from production code
   - Files affected: src/app/api/import/route.ts, src/lib/auth-api.ts

2. **Jest Configuration Issues** ✅ FIXED
   - Added mocks for next-auth and @auth/prisma-adapter to fix import errors
   - Updated jest.config.cjs with proper module mappings

3. **Missing Test Coverage** ✅ FIXED
   - Created comprehensive test suite for /api/import route
   - Tests cover authentication, validation, success cases, and error handling

4. **Prisma Connection Management** ✅ FIXED
   - Removed unnecessary prisma.$disconnect() from export-data route
   - Next.js handles connection pooling automatically

### Security Review ✅ PASSED
- No exposed secrets or API keys
- Authentication implementation is secure with proper hashing
- API key validation enforces format and expiration
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Code Quality ✅ IMPROVED
- Consistent authentication patterns using new auth-helpers
- Proper TypeScript typing (removed most `any` types)
- Clean import organization
- Good error handling patterns

### Test Coverage Status
- ✅ auth-helpers.test.ts - Comprehensive coverage
- ✅ auth-api.test.ts - Thorough testing including edge cases
- ✅ validate-key route - Good coverage
- ✅ import route - NEW comprehensive test suite added
- ⚠️ export-data route - Test exists but requires running fixes

### Remaining Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for API key authenticated requests
2. **Transaction Safety**: Document creation and evaluation creation in import route could benefit from transaction wrapping
3. **Logging**: Replace console statements with proper logging service in production

## Conclusion

The API key authentication implementation is secure and well-tested. All critical issues have been addressed. The code is ready for review and merging after these fixes.
