## Potential Conflict Areas

### 1. Text Location Finding System
**Issue**: Multiple refactorings of the same system across commits
- Commit 1: Enhanced text-location-finder with complex uFuzzy logic
- Commit 4: Converted everything to async and created wrappers
- Commit 5: Simplified uFuzzy implementation (removed much of commit 1's work)
- Commit 6: Added back some functionality to textLocationFinder.ts

**Resolution**: The final state appears stable with:
- Simplified uFuzzy implementation
- Async wrappers around the core fuzzy-text-locator tool
- Proper test coverage

### 2. Test Scripts Deletion
**Issue**: Multiple commits deleted test scripts
- Commit 3: Deleted 9 debug scripts (test-ufuzzy-*, test-spelling-*, etc.)
- Commit 6: Deleted 5 more scripts (create-test-job.ts, test-text-location-strategies.ts, etc.)
- My session: Deleted 5 additional scripts

**Potential Conflict**: Some scripts might have been useful for debugging
**Resolution**: Most were temporary debug scripts, deletion seems appropriate

### 3. Forecast Plugin Changes
**Issue**: Multiple modifications to forecast plugin
- Commit 3: Added error boundary and improved error handling
- Commit 4: Minor import changes
- My session: Fixed hardcoded userId

**Resolution**: Changes are complementary, no conflicts

### 4. Document Chunker
**Issue**: Modified in commit 6 and my session
- Commit 6: Added line fixes
- My session: Fixed initial content offset bug

**Resolution**: Changes address different issues, no conflicts

## Areas of Concern

### 1. Over-simplification of uFuzzy
- Commit 1 added sophisticated uFuzzy logic with 651 lines
- Commit 5 reduced it to minimal implementation
- **Risk**: Lost functionality that might have been valuable

### 2. Async Migration Completeness
- Commit 4 started async migration
- My session completed it
- **Risk**: Some callers might not have been updated

### 3. Test Coverage
- Many test files were deleted
- Some sophisticated tests (like comprehensive-search.test.ts) were removed
- **Risk**: Reduced test coverage for edge cases

## Recommendations

1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Already done - tests pass ✓

2. **Check for Orphaned Imports**: Look for any remaining references to deleted files

3. **Verify uFuzzy Functionality**: Ensure the simplified version handles all necessary cases

4. **Document Chunker Testing**: Verify the offset fix works correctly

5. **Consider Re-adding Some Tests**: The comprehensive-search.test.ts might have had valuable edge cases

## Overall Assessment

**No Critical Conflicts Found**: The commits build on each other logically:
1. Enhanced text finding → Renamed tool → Cleaned up scripts → Major refactor → Simplification → Final fixes

The progression shows iterative improvement rather than conflicting changes. The final state appears stable with all tests passing.
