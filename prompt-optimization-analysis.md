# Prompt Optimization Analysis

## Before Optimization

### System Prompt (will be cached after ~1024 tokens)
- Basic instruction: "You are a professional proofreader..."
- Agent instructions: variable
- Convention context: variable
- Basic guidelines: ~200 tokens

**Total System Prompt: ~400-600 tokens**

### User Prompt (repeated for each chunk)
- "Please analyze the following text..."
- Full analysis instructions: ~300 tokens
- Examples: ~200 tokens
- Focus areas: ~200 tokens
- Special cases: ~100 tokens
- Actual content: variable (500-3000 tokens)

**Total User Prompt: ~1300+ tokens per chunk**

## After Optimization

### System Prompt (cached after first use)
- Professional proofreader instruction
- Agent instructions: variable
- Convention context: variable
- ALL analysis instructions moved here
- ALL examples moved here
- ALL focus areas moved here
- ALL special cases moved here
- ALL guidelines moved here

**Total System Prompt: ~1400-1600 tokens**

### User Prompt (repeated for each chunk)
- Simple instruction: "Analyze the following text..."
- Actual content: variable (500-3000 tokens)

**Total User Prompt: ~550-3050 tokens per chunk**

## Token Savings Per Chunk

- **Before**: 1300+ tokens of repeated instructions
- **After**: ~50 tokens of simple instruction
- **Savings per chunk**: ~800-1250 tokens

## Cost Impact Example (26-chunk document)

### Before Optimization
- System: 500 tokens × 1 = 500 tokens
- User: 1300 tokens × 26 chunks = 33,800 tokens
- **Total: 34,300 tokens**

### After Optimization  
- System: 1500 tokens × 1 = 1500 tokens (cached)
- User: 550 tokens × 26 chunks = 14,300 tokens
- **Total: 15,800 tokens**

### Savings
- **Token reduction**: 18,500 tokens (54% savings)
- **Cost reduction**: ~$0.18 per document (at current Claude rates)
- **Cumulative savings**: For 100 documents = ~$18 saved

## Additional Benefits

1. **Prompt Caching**: System prompt is cached after first use, so subsequent chunks get even better performance
2. **Reduced Latency**: Smaller user prompts = faster processing
3. **Better Consistency**: All instructions in system prompt for better model adherence
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Instructions centralized in system prompt

## Implementation Notes

- Moved all static content to system prompt
- Kept only dynamic content (actual text) in user prompt
- Maintained all functionality and accuracy
- Added clear section headers for better organization
- Ready for Anthropic's prompt caching feature
